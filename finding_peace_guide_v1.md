# Part 1: Introduction

## Why You Should Read This Guide

There was one conversation with a stranger I had earlier this year that stuck out. They asked me: "What is one thing you genuinely wish for?"

I didn't even give myself a chance to think before replying right away: "I just want some peace... I just want some peace in my life."

**You should read this guide:**

- If you also want to find some peace in your life
- If you feel like you are constantly fighting your mind and your body, or that they are both just breaking down
- If you feel like everything is falling apart in your life or the world
- If you genuinely want to improve yourself and help other people

---

## Who Am I?

- I was born and grew up in Palestine (in the West Bank), and my family moved to Canada when I was 6. I saw what a lack of access to healthcare really meant, and I wanted to change that, so I went to medical school.
- I trained to be a medical doctor at the University of Toronto, but I left before residency to build an AI healthcare startup ([Semantic Health](https://betakit.com/semantic-health-acquired-by-us-based-medical-documentation-firm-aapc/)). We focused on building AI for improving medical coding for hospitals in North America, and I worked on it from 2019-2025 and then sold the company.
- I will also be very open: I struggled (and still do sometimes) with my own mental health a lot. I had anxiety and depression for pretty much all of my 20s, a psychiatrist for many years, and tried a whole bunch of different things to find some peace, like antidepressants and therapy.
- After many years, and trying many things, I've finally started finding my own peace. And I want to share my own experience with what genuinely worked for me. I believe that everyone can find their own peace, and it is something that you can work towards in your life starting today, no matter who you are or what cards you've been dealt. And if this guide helps at least 1 person do that, it's good enough for me.
- A side note: I really do believe AI can help us reduce our suffering and find peace, but it has many risks. I am currently focused on building AI for improving our mental and spiritual health, but this is early.

## How Is This Guide Structured?

This guide will be as simple and clear as possible. I know we all don't have much time, so I tried to make it as short as possible. And I hope you can make it through this in a few sittings.

- **Part 2: Finding Your Peace** - This part will share the most fundamental principles I've found that help me every day with finding my inner peace. It will be focused on practical advice. I also won't get into religious or spiritual topics - I believe what I will share can apply to everyone. You also don't need to do everything that I say, but I will share what I found worked the best for me. Everyone's life and journey are different. If something doesn't make sense for you, don't do it.

- **Part 3: Keeping Your Peace** - This part will focus on other important things you should pay attention to if you want to keep your peace in the long-run. I've included my tips on what matters, what doesn't, and the psychology of it all. Again, take it at face value and do what makes sense for you.

- **Part 4: Channeling Your Peace** - This part will focus on practical ways to direct your peace into productive work, action, and service to others.

- **Part 5: Conclusion and Parting Words** - Self-explanatory.

## Some Disclaimers

- Yes, I am a doctor, but I am not a practicing doctor (I left before residency to build my startup). And I am not your doctor. So please do not mistake this for clinical or medical advice. For clarity, these are my own personal views about how to find peace, from my own direct experience and knowledge. I'm also 31, so I definitely don't know a lot of things, and I don't claim to have all the answers. I'm just speaking from my own experience.

- Do not take what I say at face value. Use your own direct experience, intuition, and common sense. And seek professional help if you think you or someone you love needs it. If you don't agree with stuff that I say, that's totally fine. You are your own master.

- I will not cover, or am not trying to intentionally cover any religious, spiritual, or political topics. I believe what I'm saying is applicable to every single one of us, and I'm not trying to tell you what to believe or put your faith in. If you think I am, ignore my advice and move on with your life.

- This guide is free - I don't need anything from you. My goal with this guide is to help you find some peace, whatever that means for you. I still struggle with this (the path is still not done for me), but I also have come a long way, and I want to share some stuff that I think will help you. If you genuinely gained some value, then please share this with someone you care about that needs to hear it :)

- Yes, I did use AI to generate this guide. However, I want to be clear that I wrote the first draft of the guide fully on my own - 90% of what you see here is my own writing and ideas from my own personal experience. I asked the AI to polish my writing (grammar, spelling, formatting) and add some examples, but to keep my writing, style, and tone intact. The core ideas are all from my personal life. The AI did not generate net new ideas or insights for me, and I did not brainstorm with it (e.g., "brainstorm 10 principles for finding peace").

- I don't claim to have all the answers, and I still struggle with doing the things I share in this guide. So this guide is as much a reminder for me as it will be for you, and I come back to it when I need to.

- There's nothing in here that I wouldn't say to myself or someone I love. In fact, the very first person I sent this to was my mom. So send this to yours too.

- Finally, please forgive any inaccuracies or incomplete thoughts. I wrote this in about 2-3 days, as I'm just trying to get the main ideas out.

# Part 2: Finding Your Peace

Based on my own experience, this is what actually started working for me for finding peace. I am going to share these as what I call "first principles."

I don't think anything here is "new" or "magical" that will blow your mind, but I've tried to articulate it in a way that will hopefully allow you to practically apply it so you see benefits within the next MONTH (if you take what I say seriously). I'm not claiming to be some guru or real doctor (:P), I just know this worked for me and I think it will work for you.

A quick note: I like to think in first principles for most things in my life. What are they? When I come across something that is hugely impactful on my quality of life or that I see as being true across many areas of my life, I keep repeating it to myself. This is a "first principle." You will of course have your own principles from your own experience (I have lots more for AI, business, etc.), but I find that these ones have worked very well for me to find and maintain my own peace.

---

## Principle 1: Peace Is a State

The first thing that's important to understand is peace is a **state**.

I will repeat this. It is a **state of being** that your mind and body experience, and by extension, that YOU experience.

States are like feelings (e.g., happy, sad, angry), but are much **stronger**. For example, if you are always feeling worried about stuff, then you are in a state of anxiety. If you are always sad about stuff, then you are in a state of depression.

When you are fully present and content with things, you are in a **state of peace**. This does not necessarily mean you are happy, blissful, or joyful. It means you are fully at peace with your current experience and the way things are. Whether or not they are going according to your "plan."

**Peace is a state of being.** You won't just magically get to it - you have to actually practice being in that state. And even when you get to it, you won't just magically stay in it. You have to figure out what keeps you in it, and what takes you out of it. And you have to **practice** staying in it. The rest of the principles below will focus on how you can do this.

But before that, how do you know if you are in a state of peace?

This will be different for everyone, but for me it's this: my mind is not a rollercoaster. It is calm, maybe even quiet, and stable. Whatever happens in my life, it stays that way. That means it stays **equanimous** to things that happen, whether they are good or bad. Whether I wanted them to happen or not. And whether I feel great about them or not.

Bad things will happen - you cannot stop them, but if you want to find peace, your mind needs to remain equanimous to these things. Good things will also happen, but it is also just as important for you to remain equanimous to these things.

I also can't really tell you if you are in peace or not. You will ultimately feel it and experience it yourself. The key signs for me are:

- **I am not averse to bad things happening.** For example, I stop paying attention to thoughts like:
  - "I don't want to go to the dentist, I hate it" and just accept that the dentist is the dentist and I have to go if I don't want to lose my teeth
  - "I don't want to talk to my boss, I don't like them" and just accept that my boss is this way and I still have to talk to them for me to do my job. I can of course take action, like giving them feedback or leaving, but my mind is not depending on my boss's mood that day for me to feel ok.

- **I am not craving for good things to happen.** For example, I stop paying attention to thoughts like:
  - "I just need my promotion. I'll be sooooo happy when I get my promotion" and accept the fact that I am trying my best and if it happens, it happens.
  - "I need to get 1000 likes on my post or I'm not a good influencer" and accept the fact that the number of likes I get is not reflective of my own worth as a person. This one is very hard.

- I find that these thoughts never really go away (maybe they will at some point), but I CAN stop reacting to them in a way that changes how I feel about myself and my life. My mind is ***chilling***, no matter what happens.

- I'm also more fully present, in the current moment. My mind is not anxious about things in the *future*, and not ruminating about things in the *past*. Whatever happens in my life, both good or bad, my mind stays equanimous.

- And finally, I feel lots of love and compassion for myself and for others.

If you think you are at peace, that is awesome :)

If you don't, the good news is you can train your mind to get to this state. Keep reading :)

**Key Takeaway:** Peace is not a destination or something that happens to you - it's a trainable state of being where your mind remains equanimous to both good and bad events. You can practice getting into this state and staying in it.

## Principle 2: You CAN Train Your Mind to Get Into a State of Peace

Some days it feels like the whole world is against you and nothing is going right. Other days you find that you can't stop thinking about what your partner said and how stupid it was and how they shouldn't have said it and how it just hurt you to your core. Other days you might be feeling so damn overwhelmed by everything you need to do and it just feels like it never stops, and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. And one day, unexpectedly, someone you love might be suffering or pass away.

I will say something very important: being in a state of peace is a **skill, and a choice**. It is something that you can practice, no matter who you are or what is happening in your life. Sometimes it will be harder, and life will throw some crazy stuff your way, but you still ultimately have a choice.

The second thing I will say, and you definitely have heard this before, is that the fastest and most effective way you can train your mind to be at peace with ANYTHING that happens in your life is... dun dun dun...

**Meditation.**

**But *correct* meditation.**

I know many people have said this, and we hear this all the time, but I never really believed in the power of meditation until recently. I tried for a long time in my 20s to meditate - I read a bunch of books, tried a bunch of techniques, but still could not sit for more than 2 minutes each time. If you feel the same way, then please don't just dismiss what I'm about to share until you actually try it for yourself. You will only start to believe in the power of meditation WHEN you experience it. Nothing I or anyone else will say will truly help until you put in the work and actually start to experience it firsthand.

You might laugh or judge me, but the reason I am so confident in what I'm about to tell you is that I went to a 10-day SILENT meditation course in Bali. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life... for 10 straight days, they took our phones away, we could not speak a single word to ANYONE, and we woke up at 4:30am and meditated for 10 hours each day. I had probably three or four mental breakdowns, where I questioned my life, why I was even here, and why I was doing this.

But I also told myself at the beginning of the course that I was going to seriously commit to trying this out, because nothing else I really tried for years could get my mind to calm down and be at peace.

So, I genuinely sat down for those 10 days and meditated for 100 hours in the deep jungle. No phone, no communication, eating a strict diet, and listening to frogs, lizards, and chickens and roosters all day (there was a farm beside us).

And *only* on the 6th or 7th day did I start to experience the benefits of meditation. Before this retreat, I could barely sit still in meditation for 2 minutes. My mind was racing, I was itching everywhere, my back would start to hurt.

After the retreat, I was sitting for **1 hour every single time without moving**. My mind was finally reaching some sort of state that resembled peace. People would still say stuff that irritated me, I would still get emails I didn't want to get, I would not get what I wanted done in the day, I would still have conflict with others. But my mind was not in this constant rollercoaster of feeling down when stuff I didn't want happened... and up when things I wanted happened.

The best way I can describe it is that my mind actually just stabilized into this calm, almost tranquil feeling. And it felt like a huge weight finally being taken off my shoulders. When I got home, I could focus for hours on the stuff that I wanted (I wrote this entire guide of ~30,000 words in under three days, for example). I was more present with the people that I cared about, with my parents, with my siblings and friends. And I felt healthy - for the first time, that I was not fighting my body and mind. That we were on the same team.

I had not really felt like that in a decade, despite being on multiple antidepressants, doing CBT, and trying a bunch of other stuff. And my physical pain - in my back and shoulder - started going away. I had this pain for a decade... 10 years. And nothing I tried really helped. 

Now I'm not saying you should drop everything, stop seeing your doctor, or go do a 10-day course like this. I'm just saying that ***I completely discounted the power of correct meditation*** until I actually experienced it.

If you don't believe me or don't want to try meditation, that's fine. I'm not here to convince or sell you anything. Just remember:

- #1. Peace is a state of being
- #2. You can train your mind to enter this state... meditation is not the only way, but it is the *best* way I've found

If you want to give it an actual shot, then read and commit to applying the next two principles.

If you don't want to give it a shot, I still recommend reading the principles as some of the concepts will set you up nicely for getting the most out of Part 3.

**Key Takeaway:** Being at peace is a learnable skill, not a lucky accident. Meditation - done correctly - is the most effective training method I've found. If you've tried meditation before and it didn't work, give the specific techniques in the next principle an honest shot.

## Principle 3: Meditation Is a Really Good Way to Train Your Mind to Find Peace

Meditation is the **fastest and most effective way** I've found to train your mind to find and maintain its inner peace.

I seriously think that meditation is just as important as going to the gym. You go to the gym to train your body. You do meditation to train your mind.

**But meditation is not the only option.** It's my favorite option, but there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Other things that can help you enter a state of peace include: journaling, self-reflection, creative activities, spending time in nature, going for walks without your phone, or simply spending quality time with your dog or someone you love. All of these can help calm your mind. But in my experience, nothing beats meditation for training your mind to be at peace with whatever happens in your life. So if you're going to try one thing, I'd start there.

I will share with you an approach you can start practicing today, as simply as possible.

But before I do that, a few disclaimers: PLEASE read these at least once.

- First, I am not an expert on meditation by any means. And the techniques I will share are also not the only way to meditate. And how I will explain it might not be fully accurate either.

- I also had to go to a 10-day course and do 100 hours of it in the proper way before I started seeing really meaningful results. A few notes on this course:
  - I highly recommend doing the ***10-day silent Vipassana*** course (the link is here: [https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/qanda](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/qanda)). They have 100+ locations around the world and courses throughout the year, so there is most likely one close to you. But I know this is not realistic for everyone (which is why I'm doing my best to share what I've learned here).
  - The courses themselves are genuinely free (like seriously free) - you can choose to donate at the end if you gained some value, but they don't force you to or pressure you. And many people didn't.
  - You don't need to be spiritual or religious to benefit, and you can belong to any religion. The techniques they teach you are all about training your mind by connecting your mind with your body.
  - The reason I recommend this course is because it will teach you the proper technique, and it provides the proper environment for you to succeed. From having the right teachers to eating healthy, whole foods, to doing this in full silence. They give you a place to stay AND food for the whole 10 days... for free. Yes, this might sound like you are becoming a monk and living in prison for 10 days... and to be honest, it kind of is... but if you take it seriously it will change your life.
  - I am not sponsored or affiliated with them, but the course did change my life and did genuinely help me find my peace. Also, being in an environment of silence (without your phone or talking) is critical to you actually training your mind faster and in a more stable way. So don't discount this.
  - I'm not saying you have to do this, or go to this level, but I am saying that what I'm about to share with you will be hard and serious work, and I don't want to share something with you, have you try it for a week, only for you to get frustrated and give up and say it doesn't work.
  - Finally, if you are an experienced meditator, you might not need this full course. But I had not seriously meditated before, so I definitely needed this. Also, the [dhamma.org](http://dhamma.org) organization is the only one I can actually endorse for these types of courses, because that's the only one I did. Your mileage may vary with other ones.

- Another disclaimer: I will also not lie to you, this will be HARD work. You will have to work to train your mind because your mind has been conditioned, since day 1, to react to everything. Every strong reaction you buy into, whether it's a craving or aversion, takes your mind out of the state of peace and into another strong emotional state. To get your mind to a stable state of peace, you have to train hard and consistently, but also correctly.
  - So it will not be easy, but when I think about why I am doing this - **to find and maintain my inner peace** - it keeps me motivated. This is one of the most important things you can be doing with your time, for both you and those you love, because it will fundamentally improve the way you experience life.

- Secondly, there are MANY many ways to meditate, and many different techniques. I will only cover what I learned at the course, as that's what I know works for me. You can also get much deeper into the techniques I cover (the rabbit hole goes deep...)

- Fourthly, if you are skeptical of meditation, like I was, please put this aside and commit, today or tomorrow, to trying the **first mental exercise** I'm about to share to the best of your ability. Then commit to doing it once a day for **30 days** and see how you feel. If you genuinely aren't seeing any changes, then ignore my advice.

- Finally, I tried to keep this section brief, but I included a lot more tips and some of my own experience for both mental exercises in the [Appendix](#appendix). **Please read them at least once - they will help you out significantly, especially if you are stuck or feeling frustrated like I was.**

---

**The Main Goal**

**Ok so this is the main goal:** We will be training your mind to be at peace, no matter what happens in your life. Whether it's good or bad.

**How will we do this?**

- Every day, find a quiet place, and sit down in whatever way is comfortable (see A Note on Sitting Comfortably below for more important detail). You need to find a position that you can sit comfortably in for some time, so experiment.
- Once you are in a comfortable position, put a timer on for **60 minutes**. You can do whatever time you want in the beginning, but work your way up to 60 minutes. Make sure your phone is on airplane mode.
- Then close your eyes. Keep them closed.
- I will give you 2 mental exercises ***below*** - start to do the first one. And only when you have completed it (**I tell you below what this means**), then move to the second one.
  - See [Mental Exercise 1](#mental-exercise-1) - this is required for you to train your mind a bit to be more focused. You will need this before moving to the second exercise.
  - See [Mental Exercise 2](#mental-exercise-2) - this one is harder than the first one, but this is when you really start to experience REAL benefits. Do your best to try to get here, and to not give up.
- Your ***main goal for the meditation*** is to complete the mental exercise you are on to the best of your ability, AND to try your best to not move and to keep your eyes closed.
  - Try to do this for as long as you can, no matter what happens.
  - **Not moving means**: no major movements of your body (correcting your posture is ok).
  - It is also ok if you need to move - don't torture yourself if you have a lot of pain and discomfort. Just take a break and get back into it.
- As you complete your meditation, and you are doing the mental exercises, you WILL start to feel some mental and physical discomfort. Your other **main GOAL is to NOT REACT** to any of them. For example:
  - Your mind might immediately start racing about some work stuff, some stuff that made you angry in the day with your partner, or what you want to eat for dinner
  - Your pain in your back might start to flare up
  - A fly might land on your arm and start tickling you
  - Your dog might start barking
  - You might get all sweaty or hot
- Your main yardstick of progress is your level of **equanimity** during the meditation, both to:
  - The physical sensations that you don't want to happen (like pain flares, discomfort, aches, racing thoughts), but also:
  - The physical sensations that you do want to happen (the biggest one is you might get subtle vibrations flowing through your body when you get advanced enough)
- This is the meditation. It seems simple, but not moving and not reacting to your physical sensations will be the hardest part. Please see the section A Note on Reacting below for important detail. 
- Again, start at whatever time you feel comfortable (even 10 minutes a day is ok in the beginning). But your end goal should be to make this a daily habit, and to do **Mental Exercise 2 for 1-2 hours a day - ideally 1 hour in the morning, 1 hour in the evening**. Work your way up to this, and take your time.

A few things that are important to remember as you make this a habit:
- Every single physical sensation that you do not react to (including pain) will train your mind to be more equanimous, and by extension, more peaceful in day-to-day life. The worse the pain is, and the more you don't react, the more you will train your mind. But again, don't torture yourself.
- The importance of doing this **every day** is that things will happen to you in your day that will destabilize your mind. It is unavoidable. The meditation practice will help you "reset" your mind and regain your peace, no matter what happens in your life. So, especially on the hardest days, prioritize at least 30-60 minutes of meditation, and you **will** feel the benefits (even more on the hard days).
- If you don't believe me, commit to 30 days, get to Mental Exercise 2, and feel the benefits for yourself.
- Finally, try to find a friend to meditate with. It might work better for you if you do it with other people, but I usually do it alone.

### Mental Exercise 1

- When you have your eyes closed, start to focus **all of your attention** on the following area of your body:
  - Your nostrils - specifically, the opening of BOTH nostrils, and the area **just inside** both of the nostrils
  - The area above your upper lip and below the bottom of your nostrils (mustache area)
  - This will create a sort of "triangular" area from the top of your nostrils to the top of your upper lip.

- For the whole meditation, try to keep **all of your attention** focused on this area. Focus specifically on feeling ANY physical sensations that come up in this area. For example:
  - The first, most obvious sensation you should focus on is your BREATH. You are always breathing, and it will always be going in and out. **Try to see if you can feel the sensation of your breath going in and out of your nostrils, and touching the skin above your upper lip.**
    - **IMPORTANT**: Do your best to NOT change or control your breath. Let it naturally go in and out. If you genuinely cannot feel your breath (I find I can't feel it when my mind is racing), then take a few harder breaths - you will for sure feel something. Then let your breath go back to normal and focus on the areas that you felt when you were breathing hard.
  - Second, try to focus on sensations **other** than your breath, but ONLY in the prescribed area. You might feel things like: tingling, itching, heat, cold, pressure, sweat, pulsations, or ANYTHING else that your mind can sense. It does not matter what physical sensation it is, as long as you feel it.
  - If you cannot feel sensations, go back to your breath. Always go back to your breath. Your breath will always be there (theoretically :P)

- While doing this, your **third MAIN GOAL will be to try to remain fully equanimous to any physical sensations, or thoughts, that happen**. Equanimity means you do your best to not react to any sensation or thought that comes up. This means:
  - You do not want "**bad**" sensations or thoughts to stop - no aversion
  - You do not want "**good**" sensations or thoughts to continue - no craving
  - Your mind is fully balanced and calm and just observing the sensation or thought. Whatever it might be.
  - Ideally, you keep your mind focused on the sensations, and not the thoughts, but the thoughts will whisk your mind away inevitably.

Like me, you might have a lot of trouble keeping your mind equanimous in the beginning. And you might actually not like meditating (I still don't fully enjoy it). But I promise you, if you commit to making this a habit ... it will get better. I could not sit still for more than 2 minutes before the course. But, by the 5th-6th day (around 50-60 hours of correct meditation) I was regularly sitting for 45-60 minutes without moving. It doesn't take as long as you think it will, but it also won't happen overnight and without serious, dedicated work.

And the key point I tell myself when I don't want to meditate is this:
  - ***The more and more I medidate, and the more I practice keeping my mind equanimous, the faster I am training my mind to enter a state of peace. This is the KEY insight of the whole thing.***

Also, when you start feeling state of peace, the meditation will get much easier. You will be a lot more equanimous to your pain and your discomfort. And the more I find I am equanimous to my pain and discomfort, the less it starts to make my mind panic and want to give up the meditation. 

It's like pushing through the wall in running ... it all feels like it's impossible and you want to give up so bad ... but you don't. And you push through. And things will get much, much easier after you push through. I promise.

I do want to say this:
- This whole exercise is very simple by design, but **incredibly** hard to master. Do NOT get discouraged if you are not making progress. I needed at least 30 hours of correct, focused practice to start feeling some sensations in the area.
  - Once you start to feel some more sensations (it can literally be anything you feel), it means that the meditation is working - your mind is getting sharper and your attention is becoming more focused. You might start to notice some improvements your mind to keep its peace in real-life as well.

- See the [Appendix](#appendix) for practical tips for Mental Exercises 1 and 2. You should read these at least once.

- For more advanced meditators, this practice is a type of ***anapana meditation***.

### Mental Exercise 2

**Important note: ONLY move to this exercise once you notice the following happen as you practice Mental Exercise 1:**

- You can keep your attention on the area above your lips and around your nostrils for **more than a few minutes** at a time
- You can do around 60 minutes of meditation a day. You might still take breaks and move around, but you set your timer for 60 minutes and you try your best. Your moving might have also gone down significantly from when you started (e.g., you were moving 10 times an hour, now it's 6).
- Less important: You will still probably have pain or discomfort, or racing thoughts, but you are less reactive to them, and you are better able to keep your attention on area above your lips and around your nostrils. You don't need to have significantly improved here, but you should start to see some slight improvements.
- For context, during the meditation course, Mental Exercise 1 took us 30 hours of focused meditation (3/10 days of the course) to get to the stage where we were **ready** to practice the second exercise. Even then some people didn't fully get there, but we moved onto exercise 2 regardless and did that for the remaining 70 hours (7/10 days). So if you get super discouraged by the first exercise, give it 30 hours or so of proper practice, then start to try the second one and see how that feels. The second one is when you really start to experience benefits. And to be honest, sometimes I find this second exercise **easier** than the first one.

Once you feel ready to move to this exercise, this is what I want you to do:

- Set a timer for 60 minutes. Make sure your phone is on airplane mode.
  - This time, you should more seriously try to not move for as long as you can. I know this is very hard, but I promise it will be worth it.
  - But also, don't push and torture yourself. Move if you need to. And always prioritize your physical health, especially if you have medical issues you are struggling with.

- For this exercise, your goal is going to be to move your attention **from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet**, and to focus on **any and all physical sensations in each part of that body that you are moving through**. While doing this, you must ensure that your mind remains equanimous to whatever physical sensations or thoughts you experience (in the same way we discussed for exercise 1). To be clear:
  - Start with your attention fully focused at the **crown of your head**, then move downwards sequentially through each body part. Through the:
    - **Scalp** - the front, sides, and top
    - **Face** - forehead, eyes, nose, lips, chin
    - **Ears** - both front and back
    - **Throat** - front and back
    - **Arms** - from the shoulders, elbows, forearms, hands, and all the way to the tips of your fingers
    - **The front of your torso** - your chest and abdomen
    - **The back of your torso** - your full upper and lower back
    - **Pelvis** - including your glutes and genitals
    - **Legs** - from your thighs, knees, lower legs, feet, to the tips of your toes
  - Once you get to the bottom, congrats you've done a single "body scan". Make sure that you don't miss any parts of your body. 
  - Now start again with another body scan, but in reverse. From the bottom of your toes to the top of your head, in reverse order.
  - Your **MAIN goal** will be to continue doing these body scans for the whole hour, while not moving for as long as possible, and maintaining equanimity of your mind as best as you can. Observe any and all physical sensations that you can feel, but ONLY in the body part that you are on.
  - If you are experiencing really bad pain or discomfort, you should take a break from the body scan, and focus all of your attention on the area of pain and discomfort. Spend 1-2 minutes there with all of your focus, but do so in equanimity:
    - Just focus on observing the pain and discomfort. What does it feel like? Where is it? Is it changing? Is it getting better or worse?
    - Do not react to thoughts that come up - like "omg this is the worst pain ever, it's getting worse, why is this happening." If these thoughts come up, it's ok. Just accept the reality of the pain and thoughts.
    - I find that even my worst pain will start to get better after 1-2 minutes of just focusing on it like this.
  - Finally, you should move through each part **slowly** and **separately**, but not slow enough that you fall asleep and get distracted - maybe 10-15 minutes to go through your whole body.

- **VERY IMPORTANT:** Do not to use any visualizations or verbalizations (like mantras or your imagination). 
  - This is very very important, because you want to focus your mind on observing your physical sensations, not on visualizing things or saying things to yourself.
  - The more you focus on observing your physical sensations, the faster you can decondition your mind away from its automatic reactions towards craving or aversion
  - And try not to play "time" games with yourself.
  - I still struggle with this all the time, but it is getting better. Just do your best. You don't need to be perfect to find your peace.

- **Some key tips (I have included more in the [Appendix](#appendix-practical-tips-for-mental-exercise-1-and-2))**
  - If you have not seriously meditated before, like I haven't, this will be **very** hard for you the first time. Which is why it's important to spend enough time doing Mental Exercise 1, which will prepare your mind to do this meditation correctly. But please stick through it. Give it a fair shot - you already made it to this exercise which is a HUGE step.
  - Once you go through a very hard meditation session, they will all get easier after that. You are putting in some serious work to find your peace. Think about that.
  - Be as thorough as possible and try to cover each part of your body.

- As you get **more advanced** in this exercise, you can progress:
  - Advanced means: you can do this for 30-ish minutes without moving and while remaining equanimous to pain/discomfort
  - In the beginning, scan each part of your body separately, but as you progress, start to scan parts of your body **simultaneously** (your arms/hands, and legs/feet specifically can be scanned simultaneously). This will prepare you for going deeper into this technique.
  - At some point, you might start experiencing **subtle tingling sensations** all over your body (this happened to me a few times). Don't get too caught up in how good they feel. If you start experiencing these, then after the end of each body scan, focus on scanning all of your body simultaneously from head to toe (and in reverse) 1-2 times - this is called scanning in free flow (or en masse). Then go back to doing the normal body scan.

**Making this a habit**
After about 60-70 hours of correct practice in Mental Exercise 2, you might be progressing nicely. Which means: 
- You can do this exercise for the whole 60 minutes, without moving and while keeping your eyes closed.
- Your mind might still be racing to other thoughts (like what to eat for dinner), and that's ok. But it is **significantly** less reactive to either the pain/discomfort you have during the meditation, or the good sensations.
- Your pain or discomfort might not fully go away - I still have my lower back pain, especially when I go to the gym. But I am not reacting to it at all these days.

When you are at this point, then congrats! You have made a lot of progress, and honestly, you will feel it. 

Your goal now should be to do at least 1 hour, but ideally 2 hours of meditation in the day: 
- 5-10 minutes of Mental Exercise 1 (if you find your mind racing or you are really agitated, do 10 min)
- 50-55 minutes of Mental Exercise 2 (this is the main practice)

You should also strive for something called **"continuity of practice"**:

The idea is simple: don't just meditate for an hour and then go back to being completely unconscious of your body and mind for the rest of the day. Try to maintain some level of awareness throughout your day.

- **Stay aware of sensations**: As you go about your day, occasionally check in with your body. What are you feeling? Are there tensions? Is your breathing shallow?
- **Catch reactions early**: When something happens that would normally make you react (anger, frustration, craving), try to notice the physical sensation before the mental reaction spirals. This is where the real training happens.
- **Bridge the gap**: The goal is for the equanimity you cultivate during meditation to carry over into your daily life. The more continuous your practice, the faster this happens.

This doesn't mean you need to be in deep meditation all day. It just means staying a bit more conscious of your body and mind, a bit more often. Even 5% more awareness throughout the day makes a huge difference over time.

**A Note on Sitting Comfortably**

- **Comfortable means:** sit in the way that will keep you sitting for the hour the longest without moving. 

For me, this means: 
- Sitting in a cross-legged position, with my butt on 1-2 pillows, and with my hands on my knees. This is the easiest way to start.
- I also like to sit in a supported kneeling position - on a pillow with my legs on either side (straddling the cushion while kneeling). I put my hands on my knees again. 

But you should experiment with what is most comfortable for you. For example, people at the course tried: 
- Sitting on 3-4 pillos, putting pillows under their feet
- Sitting with back support (I would not recommend support your back unless you have a medical condition or really debilitating pain ... see the note on sitting in an Active position below for why this is important)
- Sitting with 
- You can try various other things like kneeling stools

Ultimately, as you meditate more and more, you will feel what positions are most comfortable. And you will get better at slightly adjusting your spine or various parts of your body to reduce the strain on them. For example, I find that when I keep my spine the most active and straight, that I get less and less back pain, or upper shoulder aches, for the meditation. You need to treat this like an experiment, and do some experimentation with how you sit. Stick with the stuff that makes you feel the most comfortable.

- Your position should be an **Active** one - this means your spine should be straight, in good posture, and ideally with nothing supporting it.
  - Nothing supporting it is very important - it means your spine is ACTIVE and that will both prevent you from falling asleep and keep your mind sharp and focused on the task. I try to meditate with an inactive spine and I don't really get the same benefits.
  - If you have lots of pain and can't do this, then get some support. But the training process will work better if your spine is active - and you also won't fall asleep.

**A Note on the Meditation Journal**

For those of you that are scientists and love experimenting, or love journalling, I recommend keeping a meditation journal. It can be a very simple journal that includes a short entry of the meditation. Things like: 
- How did you feel before, during, and after the meditation?
- How equanimous did you remain? What physical sensations or thoughts took your mind out of equanimity? How long did it take for you to regain your equanimity?
- How much pain or discomfort did you experience? 
- How many times did you move?
- Did you try new things and how did they work (like sitting differently, or eating a small breakfast right before, or turning your phone off for 20 min before)? **Many, many things will impact your meditation. Start to take notice.** For example, I find that the more I have something going on in my life that is stressing me out, the harder it becomes to fully focus on the body scans. But as I do 3-4 body scans, my mind settles in. Your mind is very, very sensitive! 
- For me, the meditation journal helps me track my progress, and also figure out what is working and what different things I can try with my posture or sitting. You **don't** have to do this, but I find it helps (I do it maybe once every 3-4 meditations). You can also incorporate this into your daily journal if you write one (I do this). I find these are useful reflection questions for daily life as well, and they will help you to remember the core concepts from this guide, especially when things get chaotic.

**A Very Important Note on Reacting**

Why is it so important for us to try our best to NOT react to physical sensations that happen during meditation? 

The simple answer is that when you don't react to a physical sensation, you are telling your mind - "I am perfectly aware of this, but I will not do anything about it". This is a very strong way to train your mind to be calm, no matter what happens. 

For example, if you are experiencing a physical sensation of strong discomfort, like pain, your mind will most likely be sending you thoughts like ("Why is this pain happening?", "Uh this pain is so so bad!", "Why can't you just go away pain"?", or more strongly "I hate you so much, lower back, for giving me all this pain. Just leave me ALONE!").  

If you observe these thoughts, especially during meditation, you will notice that they are mostly all automatically happening as **reactions of aversion** by your mind - you don't really have a choice in the matter. Your mind is sending you these thoughts, and they get more and more intense as your pain gets more intense .. until you do something about it (like move to make the pain go away). But this is what your mind wants. For you to react to its aversion, because it wants the pain to go away, and it wants YOU to do something about it.

The power of this type of meditation, is that the more and more you sit there, notice these thoughts, and tell yourself, I'm not moving .. you can throw as many of these thoughts at me you want, but I will not move .. The more and more you do this, the faster you train your mind to chill out. To be at peace, with whatever happens. Of course, you SHOULD treat yourself with compassion and MOVE if you really need to, especially if your pain is bad and you have had chronic or serious pain. 

Do not torture yourself for the sake of training your mind. You are doing this from a place of love, for both you and your mind. Sometimes I tell my mind, especially in really hard meditations when I have lots of pain, "I love you a lot. We're on the same team, and we're going to get through this". I take a break (yes I move), and I give myself a hug for a few minutes. That helps a lot to calm my mind down. YES you can talk to your mind like this and yes it will calm down.

The more and more you practice not reacting during meditation, the more this WILL translate to your mind being more chill, and more at peace, in real-life. Especially when things don't go your way. 

And it's **just as important** to do this when things do go your way. Like you get a huge promotion, or you feel subtle vibrations flowing through your body during meditation. When things go your way, your mind might send you thoughts like ("This feels so good") and they might genuinely feel good. But the more and more you react to these thoughts, the more these thoughts become "Let's do more of this". And if you keep reacting, they become "I *need* this". And finally they might become "I *need* this, **RIGHT NOW**, or else I will feel like crap!!!". You go from genuinely having a pleasant experience, to seeking it, to clinging to it to it, to finally CRAVING it. All at the expense of the peace of your mind.

The problem is that, in life, we don't have that much control over when things will go our way. So if we are constantly reacting to the thoughts our mind throws at us (in both situations), our mind will never be at peace. It's like it's on a constant emotional rollercoaster, and it's taking you along for the ride whether you like it or not. 

This might sound scary or hopeless, but the key point is this: You ultimately have a choice to react or not to your mind. 

But it's very hard to make that choice to not react when you haven't trained your mind. Because if you haven't trained your mind, it will automatically be throwing these strong reactions at you all the time, every day. To the small stuff. To the big stuff. That's what it's been trained to do since day 1. 

That's why meditation is like going to the gym, but for your mind.

Even when you accept this reality, and agree with everything I say, your mind will still react. Knowing something is not the same as feeling or directly experiencing it. And that's why meditation is important. It is the way to teach your mind.

As you practice meditation, you will still react. Both during the meditation and in life. **Don't beat yourself up.** I react all the time. As long as you are genuinely doing your best, you should measure yourself by how fast you catch the reaction, and by how fast you get back into your peace. Every time you catch your reaction, you are ALSO training your mind not to react as strongly next time. So it's all progress, one way or another.

Finally, when we talk about not reacting during meditation, try your best to not react to both physical sensations (like pain or discomfort) or mental thoughts (like your mind racing, or how you need to tell your brother this or that). You might be tempted to react. DON'T. *This* is the true test of the meditation.

For example:
- **Physically**, this means you remain sitting in the same position - do not make major movements (correcting your posture if it droops is ok) and DO NOT open your eyes
  - You might be tempted to scratch that itch, but do your best not to. Instead move your attention to the itch and just try to focus all of your mind on the sensation of the itch you feel. Do not think to yourself "I want this to go away." If you do scratch the itch, don't beat yourself up, just move on.
  - You might be tempted to move your leg if it falls asleep. Try not to. I was so scared the first time my leg REALLY fell asleep during the meditation course that I started panicking. But I stayed with it and after 20 minutes it actually just went away and I could feel my leg. You will NOT lose your leg if it falls asleep.
  - You might be super duper tempted to move your back or knees because your knees are sore or your back is so painful. Do your best to NOT do this (but again it's ok if you do). This is one of the hardest tests I faced for pain and discomfort, and it might be for you too. But the **longer you hold still and don't react**, the more you will benefit from the meditation.
    - **DISCLAIMER**: I will keep saying this over and over. The goal is to train our mind, not to inflict self-torture. So of course, if you have a medical condition or serious pain in these areas, you should sit with proper back support or on a chair. If you get really bad pain during the meditation, then by all means, move. You know your body.
  - Finally, you might be tempted to check your phone or a clock - DO NOT do this. In fact your phone should be on airplane mode and away from you (ideally).

- **Mentally**, this means you do your best not to react to thoughts like:
  - "I want this pain to be over, why is this happening to me"
  - "OMG, this pain sucks so much why can't it go away"
  - "How much time is left? I think it's 20 min?" - time was the biggest mental struggle for me. The more I let myself think about time, the harder the meditation got and the WORSE my pain got. So try your best to not react to thoughts like, "I just started, I can't believe we have 50 minutes left", to things like "I've been doing this for SO long now, the timer has to go off now. It **HAS** to be over soon". These thoughts are the biggest traps, and they will make it so MUCH harder to finish the meditation. They will make you quit the fastest. So when you have them, observe them, and don't react!
  - "Stupid fly, why did you have to land on my arm when I'm meditating"
  - "I'm so hungry, I want that cold pizza in the fridge"


- **Thoughts will continue to come up (they do for me all the time), but it's ok.**
- I find that my mind will play differnt "mind" games with me at different times during really hard meditations - sometimes it's about the time, sometimes it's about the pain, sometimes it's guilt about not spending enough time with my family. Do NOT react. Your mind will play games with you, and the more you react to it, the more games it will play, and the harder the meditation will be. But the more you don't react to it, the better you will feel after the meditation. Try it and see for yourself.
  - Especially if your mind always races, or you are an overthinker like I am, then thoughts will come at you fast. It's fine if that happens, but your goal should be to observe these thoughts. Start to notice that they are thoughts coming up. And do NOT let yourself get wrapped up in the emotion they stir up - like frustration or anger at the pain, or annoyance and irritation at the fly. Strong thoughts will always stir up strong emotions.
  - You might not be able to do this in the beginning, but just remind yourself this that you will try your best, and that this is the main goal before you meditate. Use this reminder during meditation to counter these thoughts. Repeat the above to yourself as much as you need to. YES, you can also play mind games back with your mind :)
  - Don't be so hard on yourself. If your thoughts or pain keep coming up and your mind gets carried away, then treat yourself with compassion. You are doing your best.
    - It WILL also get better. In the beginning it might take you 5 minutes to get your mind back on track to the mental exercise. But if that goes down to 4 minutes the next day, then you are making progress.

**Why Are We Doing This Meditation in This Way?**
This is more detail on the theory behind the meditation. I covered some above, but this might help expand:
- We are essentially training your mind to remain equanimous to any physical sensation that comes up during the hour that you meditate.
- This means ZERO reactions to craving (wanting good sensations to continue) or aversion (wanting bad sensations to stop).
- The two mental exercises will be hard enough that they will present your mind with some pain and discomfort, and eventually some good sensations - BOTH of these are the training ground! So do not get frustrated at your pain. It is fuel.
- When your mind becomes able to truly remain equanimous at the level of your physical sensations, you will also find that you are able to keep your level of equanimity at EVERY level of your experience. This includes in events that happen in your life.
- Your ability to keep your equanimity is essentially your ability to stay in your state of peace. This is a skill you can practice with this meditation (you can do it in other ways, but this meditation approach seems like the simplest and it has worked for me).
- **So through this we are training your mind to enter into, and stay in a state of peace, no matter what happens to you :)**

Finally, one more thing that our teacher used to say: "Continuity is the secret of success."

- This means that the training does not need to stop when you stop meditating
- You can continue training your mind with **ANYTHING** you are doing - like brushing your teeth, driving your car, waiting in line, having a fight with your partner...
- To do this, try to get into the habit of being more and more aware of:
  1. What you are doing (e.g., "I am brushing my teeth")
  2. What physical sensations you are feeling right now (e.g., "I feel the cold water on my teeth")
- The more you do this, the more and more you will train your mind, and the easier it will be to stay in peace, especially when things that you DON'T want happen. But meditation is still the strongest, fastest training ground.
- You can also make it fun, and add some color commentary to what you are doing (e.g., "I'm hanging out with my friends and we are making fun of each other like always")

**Key Takeaway:** Meditation trains your mind to stay equanimous to physical sensations, which translates directly to staying equanimous to life events. The key is consistent daily practice (work toward 1-2 hours) with the right technique - focusing attention, not reacting, and maintaining equanimity. Remember: "Continuity is the secret of success." If you take both of these exercises seriously, then I promise you will start to see some major shifts in your life. But you need to work seriously - continuously, diligently, patiently, persistently, and ardently. This is what the teacher used to say. And it really helped me a lot to maintain my motivation. This is probably the most important thing you will do in your day if you seriously commit to it.

## Principle 4: Recognizing Peace When It Hits You

As you practice the Mental Exercises above, or find your own, your mind might finally go quiet.

Your racing thoughts might start to weaken. Your chronic pain might start to feel manageable. You might start noticing the more subtle things around you. Things are starting to go well. Things are starting to change for you.

The more you commit to and practice the exercises in Principle 3, the more you WILL start to experience some of these, and many more, changes in your life.

How do you know I'm telling the truth? **You** have to do the HARD work and experience it for yourself. I can't do the work for you. Your partner can't do it for you. There's nothing I will tell you below that you won't eventually experience on your own.

**But, I will share a few things that I've noticed:**

- First, you will start to notice some key changes happening in your life. I don't know what they will be for you, but for me:
  - I am now able to focus for many hours in a day on my most important tasks (including writing this guide in under 3 days)
  - I am able to get everything I want done, including meditating for 2 hours a day, going to the gym, focusing on my deep work, eating healthy, spending time with my family and friends, having fun, and also disconnecting from my phone and doing stuff I like.
  - I am not swinging up and down emotionally, especially when people let me down or when I let others down.
  - I am still reacting to things, but I am now able to recognize when I have a deep craving or aversion to something and I snap out of it faster. For example, I used to REALLY hate taking the little sieve thing out of the kitchen sink when it has lots of nasty food (like it would make me shiver), and now I can do it without reacting. Small example, I know, but I try to hold myself to this standard across the little things too.
  - My relationships with people I care about are more authentic, transparent, and honestly way more fun. A lot of times I used to struggle with my relationships, I was averse to conflict or to speaking up for myself, and now I understand when I am not doing that and I take action much faster. This helped me to really be more present with people I care about and honestly repair the relationships I care about.
  - I don't use my phone as often... coming from a tech startup CEO, this might seem crazy to you, but I genuinely leave my phone off for days sometimes, and I have never felt more at peace. I talk about the impact of technology on peace in the next section.

- Second, there is a more direct way to measure your level of peace (if you want to get more scientific :P). Focus on how much ***equanimity*** you have to both the good things AND bad things, in BOTH your meditation and in your life:
  - You can figure out if you are doing this with a quick reflection after your meditation or at the end of your day: ***How much equanimity did I maintain after this session, or today? Where could I have improved?***
  - In your meditation practice, you might start to notice that you are more "immune" to the pain and discomfort (so-called bad sensations), and that they will slowly start to either go away or become more manageable
  - In your real life, you might start to notice that you are more immune to things that don't go your way. Someone cuts you off? So what, I'm equanimous. Your boss yells at you? So what, I'm equanimous. Your general dissatisfaction (and satisfaction) with life will slowly start to turn into equanimity. If you don't believe me, then *do* the work and experience it for yourself.

- Ask yourself, for the big and little things, this: **"Is reacting to this *really* worth the cost of my peace?"** This helps me, especially in the heat of the moment, to not react and to maintain my peace.

- **It is important that you also remain equanimous to the GOOD things too, for example:**
  - You love your dog so much and you just can't imagine a day where your dog will pass away.
    - I have a dog and this used to make me so sad, but now I understand that this is a part of life. All living things are born and will pass away at some point.
    - I'm not saying don't love your dog, and don't treat your dog with the utmost of respect and care (I love my dog more than anything!). I'm saying don't let your mind cling too much to the idea that your dog will live forever. This is what will ultimately cause deep suffering when your dog passes away. That is equanimity.
  - In your meditations, you might start to feel some pleasant sensations - like subtle vibrations moving through your body. You want these to continue because they feel sooo good. But as soon as you cling to the idea of these sensations continuing, your mind has trapped you... it will start to crave them. And to be honest, in my experience, these sensations stop when I start craving for them to continue.
  - Good things start to happen in your life as a result of the meditation - people around you start treating you differently, you start making progress in your job, you start feeling healthy, your relationships improve. It is **especially important** to remain equanimous to all these. If you don't create REALLY strong cravings and attachments to each of these, you won't fear losing them, and you won't lose your peace if they go away. And that is one of the biggest killers of your peace. Protect your peace.

- If you're looking at me and saying, Nick, I can't even sit for 2 minutes in the first exercise, how do you expect me to do this long enough to get these benefits?
  - My answer to you is "I know": I couldn't sit for 2 minutes when I started, but I PROMISE you that every hour you commit to this, you will see improvements.
  - In 4 days of intense practice at the retreat I went from moving every 2 minutes and getting so pissed off at my lower back pain, to sitting for 1 hour without moving, even with lots of pain and a racing mind that never stops.
  - Do not cling too much to the idea that you will get benefits. Whether the benefits come or they don't, you are trying your best, and you are doing the work you need to, and that is good enough. I find this is good advice for pretty much everything else in life too.

- **An interesting thing: you will slowly start to realize during your meditations that both good and bad sensations will ALWAYS go away:**
  - The pain doesn't last forever
  - The tingly vibrations don't last forever
  - Things will always arise, and always pass away. All of your sensations, and events in life, are impermanent. Once you fully start to experience this in meditation, it will help you to accept it in real life.

- **Finally, you will start to truly understand the power of your mind:**
  - When you react and lose focus on the mental exercises (e.g., "omg pain why are you so bad, stop it"...), you will find that it will be harder to complete the mental exercise - you can't keep your attention on your breathing during exercise 1, or you can't feel sensations on specific parts of your body during exercise 2.
  - The more you focus on your pain, the worse the pain will get. The less you focus on your pain (by focusing on your mental exercise), the better the pain gets. You have to experience this to believe it because I sure could not believe it.
  - You will start to experience the IMMENSE power of your mind to actually create your reality. Your mind determines what thoughts you perceive, how you feel, and as a result, everything else in your life. A lot of your actions, behaviors, habits, and outcomes in your life are a result of the thoughts you have and which ones you choose to react to or not.
    - When you let your mind tell you what to crave and what to avoid, you are giving away your control to it.
    - YOU are not your mind. Your mind has been conditioned from your birth to react in automatic ways and to crave things it likes or to become averse to things it doesn't like. This has all been based on your experience, your genetics, your environment. (I go much deeper on the topic of conditioning in [Part 3: Free Yourself from Your Mind](#principle-3-free-yourself-from-your-mind).)
  - You are the only one that can do the hard work to actually get your mind to a state of peace. You are the only one that can fight your own battles and get to your peace.
  - And to be honest, there is no other way for you to believe what I'm saying here unless you do the work and experience it for yourself. So take the practice seriously, or at least, commit to finding your own way of getting your mind into a state of peace. Again this practice I shared is the main thing in my life that has worked for me, and I've tried a lot of things. You might be totally different.
  - In any case, when you find peace, you will know it :)

At this point, you might be thinking, Nick... did I really need to read all this way for you to tell me that I need to meditate?

And my answer is **yes**. I really do believe that meditation is like going to the gym, but for your mind.

My biggest problem with meditation for more than 10 years has been that I didn't know what to do and how to do it. That's why I am giving you a simple blueprint for how to get started in this section. I really do believe that these mental exercises will help you if you seriously, and properly, work on them. They are not going to be easy, but they will work if you do the work.

PS: Just like there's a whole bunch of different ways to exercise, the mental exercises I shared in Principle 3 are not the only ones out there, but they are ones that I know work for me.

**Key Takeaway:** You'll know peace is working when your equanimity increases - both during meditation (less reactivity to pain/pleasure) and in daily life (less emotional swings). The key signs are increased focus, emotional stability, better relationships, and the experiential realization that all sensations and events are impermanent. Don't cling to the benefits themselves - just do the work.

# Part 3: Keeping Your Peace

I won't lie to you, you will have to do some actual HARD work to find your peace. No one will be able to fight your battles for you, or meditate for you, and I tried not to sugar coat or gloss over that in Part 2.

And once you start to find your inner peace, you will also have to do MORE hard work to maintain it. Like I mentioned, peace is a state. Your mind can ***easily*** be knocked out of that state, no matter how good you are at getting into it, or how awesome your meditation is. And in our modern society, the reality is that there are **1000s of things you experience** every day that will knock you (and me) out of that state.

This section will give you my honest thoughts on how to keep living in a state of peace, especially in our modern technology-driven world. You might not like to hear some of this, and that's ok, but again this is my own personal experience and you don't have to agree with or follow everything I say.

---

## Principle 1: Your Peace Is What You Pay Attention To

If you have ever felt like you can't focus, that your mind is foggy, that you plan so much in your day and you never get anything done, or that your attention span is worse than a 2-year-old, then you are not alone.

I used to feel like that every single day. And every day I beat myself up for not being productive. And not doing what I wanted to do. And for not feeling like "myself."

The reality is that we are living in an **extremely hyper-stimulating world**. Our minds are not designed for this level of stimulation. Phones/technology, food, news, work, life, children, etc. are just way too much and our minds have not caught up.

**Key insight:** Your mind is extremely sensitive to what you pay attention to - I will call this your **information diet**. If you don't practice not reacting, then every-time you pay attention to something, whether in real life or the digital world, your mind *will* create a reaction. This reaction might manifest as some physical sensation, or a thought, feeling, or mood. It will ultimately determine how you behave and how you act. And it will ultimately determine whether or not you are at peace.

I don't want to scare you, but every single craving or aversion your mind creates CAN cause you to lose your equanimity and peace. If your mind is not trained to notice this or to get back to it, you *will* feel a pile-up of these reactions over time. Some of the things you might be feeling are:

- **Lack of focus and concentration** - you can't sit down for 2 minutes and meditate. You just pull out your phone whenever you have free time
- **Low energy** - you aren't motivated to do things and feel like your energy just crashes like 2 hours into the day, even with a coffee
- **Low mood** - you feel so negative about yourself and the world and things in general
- **Irritability or restlessness** - you are easily annoyed, frustrated, and pissed off at little and big things
- **General dissatisfaction** - with your life, with others, with existence

Of course, some of these symptoms can be related to serious physical or mental health issues, but my main point is this:

- **It is extremely important for you to PAY ATTENTION to what you are paying attention to.**

**A Key Example: Social Media**

I'm going to spend some time covering social media here because I struggled with this a lot and I think this **really impacts our peace in the modern world**.

Again, to be very blunt: Your social media feed alone will stimulate your mind so much that it will short-circuit it (through your dopamine system). What this means in plain English is that the way the tech companies are designing social media is to get you to stay on social media for AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. They do this by giving you small, but endless, hits of things that create STRONG reactions in your brain. Your brain gets trained over time to crave these little hits, and you find yourself instinctively reaching into your pocket every free second you have for MORE.

If this is you right now, please don't beat yourself up. It's not your fault. You and I live in a **dopamine casino** - a digital environment designed to keep us playing the slot machine that is our social media fee. Why? Because that's how companies make money, and they spend billions of dollars figuring out how to do this more optimally.

The key point is this: **The more you watch or engage with their social media platform, the more "attention" you give them, and the more ads they can sell to companies.** There's a reason social media is free for you and me... **we** are the product they are selling.

This means that your phone is designed to continuously serve you up content that will make your mind react in a strong and emotionally charged way - either with a strong negative reaction ("How could this have happened? Why is the WORLD so bad? People suck"), or with a strong positive reaction ("OMG that cat is soooo cute", "That person is so hot, I want to know all about them").

You might think this is all harmless fun, but the hard truth is that every single time you are watching one of these videos, your mind is instinctively generating a REALLY strong reaction, and it's usually one of craving or aversion. Every single time you generate this reaction, your mind will lose its equanimity, and you will lose your peace.

It's like the **opposite** of what we're trying to do with meditation!

**So ask yourself this** - is that video truly worth your peace? If you really think so, then keep doom scrolling.

A side note: 
I'm sorry to be this blunt and direct, but one of the MOST beneficial things that the 10-day meditation course did was to **take my phone away**. Yes, it was extremely hard at first, because I was also doom scrolling. I literally felt withdrawals for the first 1-2 days. But then I got used to it. And I moved on, and at some point, I did not want my phone back.

So that's my challenge to you after reading this... put your phone away for an hour and go outside and do something. Go tell your mom you love her and miss her. Go do something for you.

I also use social media as the key example of a *dangerous* thing to constantly give your attention to, because it will train your mind to react to every single little thing with a very strong aversion or craving.

But... this principle also works in the other way. For example, if you give your attention to things that truly energize you - your hobbies, passions, family, nature - then you will slowly start to feel more and more like yourself. When you give your attention to things that are authentically you, your moods, thoughts, and feelings will slowly change. This will not happen overnight, but it will start to happen.

*If you want more tips on detoxing from technology and social media, see the section [On Technology](#on-technology) in Principle 4 below.*

**Key Takeaway:** You are what you pay attention to. If you spend hours doom scrolling, your mind gets trained to automatically generate strong reactions that hijack your peace. Curate your information diet as carefully as you curate your food diet - both directly impact your mental state and ability to maintain equanimity.

## Principle 2: Your Peace Is What You Do

This is not going to be mindblowing news to most people reading this, but I think it needs to be said:

***Your mind and body are extremely connected.***

What you do with your body will impact your mind. And what you do with your mind will impact your body.

This means that your physical habits and actions are just as important as your mental ones for **keeping your peace**.

- **Disclaimer**: If you need specific guidance on any of these, please understand that this is **not official** medical advice and you need to seek professional help. To be clear, I will not go into details here about what to do to take care of your physical health, and I will not give you medical advice. But I will share what is important, from my experience, to keep your peace.

This will include things that you already know or might sound obvious, but I will cover them regardless, and I will focus on explaining how they might be causing you to lose your peace.

--- 

**The Basics First**

These are the basic things we were told to commit to **not** doing during the 10-day course for best results:

- Don't kill
- Don't steal
- Don't commit sexual misconduct (like sexual assault)
- Don't lie

I'm not going to go in depth on these, other than to say that if your mind is at a place where it can justify doing these things (especially the first 3), it will be really hard for you to maintain your peace... and you might also end up in jail.

- I also understand this is a broad generalization, and we have things like war and soldiers that need to go fight in wars. But I hope you agree that we should generally not be going around killing, stealing, or committing sexual assault.
- Lying is a very difficult one, and I'm sure we all lie (intentionally or not). I struggle with it too. But I try to do my best to tell my truth, AND not hide my truth when I know it needs to be said. That's the standard I hold myself to.

Now onto some things that are going to be harder for us to do well (including myself)...

--- 

**Your Diet**

Your actual diet is just as important as your information diet.

This is because your body is much, much smarter and able to influence your mind than you give it credit for.

I will keep this as simple as possible:

I won't tell you what to eat or how to eat, but I will tell you that WHAT you eat will impact how you feel, and by extension, your peace.

For example, I was recently reading about the brain-gut connection ([Hopkins Medicine article](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-brain-gut-connection)) and also the book "The Gut-Brain Paradox" (by Dr. Steven Gundry). The key points:

- We have lots of bacteria in our gut (this is called the microbiome). There are various species of them, and they can send signals up to your brain.
- These signals might impact how you think or feel, and it might be different depending on which types of bacteria (and how much) you have.
- The type of food you eat can actually determine which of these bacteria grow more, and in what quantities!
- So if you're eating sugary, processed foods, you might get a different type of microbiome than if you're eating whole, unprocessed foods. And this might change the signals going from your gut to brain. And ultimately how you feel.

I'm not an expert on this by any means, but I did *feel* significantly different after fully changing my diet for 10 days at the meditation course. We didn't have a choice about what to eat - they cook the same food for everyone every single day: a breakfast and a lunch of vegetarian, whole foods (rice, mixed veggies, tofu, a veggie soup, fruits, salad, etc.). It was also much easier to meditate, and to stay focused on my meditation.

For context, before the course I was eating everything and anything, including binge eating a bunch of McDonald's the weekend before. The change I felt in my body, and by extension my mind, was significant. I felt a lot more "light", less bloaty, more energized, and overall more like myself. Of course, this could have been a whole host of other things, like the meditation, no phone, or more sunlight. But I think the diet really had an impact on my mood, and ultimately my peace.

I also still struggle with my diet, as do a lot of us, because in our modern world all of our options in the grocery store and restaurants are full of processed or sugary foods. But my goal this new year is to eat more whole, plant-based foods.

So the key thing to take away is this: Next time you eat a greasy burger, just pay closer attention to how your body and mind feel. I know I am being super pushy with this point, but it's also a reminder to myself... I have to tell myself this a few times a day because I LOVE BURGERS, but I also have noticed that they make me feel like crap for HOURS after.

**So next time you eat something that you think might be causing you to feel like this, ask yourself: "Is this thing I am about to enjoy for 5 minutes really worth 5 hours of my peace?"**

--- 

**Exercise and Sleep**

Secondly, exercise and sleep are two other things to pay close attention to.

I will go into these very briefly, but for sleep, please try to:

- Get 6-8 hours of sleep, at the same time every day. And leave your phone off the last hour before bed or your mind will race a lot more!
- I'll leave it at that
- When you are not sleeping well, your mind will not be able to function properly over time, and you will definitely lose your peace. You might think you need 3-4 hours of sleep, but there are only so many times you will be able to do that until you burn out (this has happened to me many times)

For exercise:

- Do something, whatever it is, to get out of your mind and into your body every day. At least 30 minutes, ideally 1 hour. A walk, hitting the gym, yoga, whatever.
- Exercise is so important to maintaining your peace, and overall physical health. It's much easier said than done, so if you struggle with this just commit to doing something physical that gives you joy.
- I used to feel like I had no energy. I would sleep for 8 hours, and still have no focus or concentration. When I exercise, I get out of my mind, and especially when I do something physically demanding (like a hard workout), my mind is forced to focus on that task and it short-circuits all of the racing thoughts. It also gives my mind a chance to rest, and I find that I have lots more interesting ideas after exercise.
- So this will only help you on your journey to keeping your peace.

--- 
**A Quick Word on Substances**

- I'm not here to judge, but it will be much, much harder to maintain your peace if you are constantly taking substances (e.g., smoking, alcohol, weed, etc.)
- The main reason is that these substances fundamentally alter the state of your mind - it's like taking the emotional rollercoaster that is alread your mind and multiplying it by 2x! It might feel good when you're on it, but as soon as you are off it, you might swing the other way. Of course you can do what you want, but if you want to keep your peace, these will have a very high chance of taking it away over time. Ask yourself if that is worth it to you, and continue if you think it is.
- A special note on psychedelics - I think they are especially powerful for healing trauma and therapy. But be careful, they can alter your mind pretty deeply.

Finally, you must find and stick to your "finding peace" practice. In the above section, I make a strong case for why correct meditation is a very simple and effective one that anyone can do. If you have your own, and it is working for you, then by all means do it. But it is important that you find a way to enter a state of peace, before you are able to maintain it.

--- 

**Specifically for correct meditation, here are the key habits I do daily:**

- **1 hour of meditation in the morning, and 1 hour in the evening**
  - 5-10 minutes of Mental Exercise 1 (if I can't focus)
  - 50-55 minutes of Mental Exercise 2
  - You don't have to do 2 hours a day. I know this is a lot. Try to do what you can. But the more you commit to, the faster you will find and keep your peace. I don't get 2 hours in every day.
  - The importance of doing this **every day** is that things will happen to you in your day that will take your peace away. It is unavoidable. The meditation practice will help you "reset" your mind and regain your peace, no matter what happens.

- **General awareness during the day**
  - My teacher used to say "Continuity is the secret of success," which means that you can also technically meditate when you are NOT meditating. Specifically:
  - You can meditate when you are doing anything - like brushing your teeth, driving your car, waiting in line
  - No, you won't be doing exercise 1 or 2, but simply try to be aware of what you are doing ("I am brushing my teeth") and what physical sensations you are feeling ("I feel the cold water on my teeth, I feel some pain in my finger"). The more and more you do this throughout the day, the easier it will be to keep your peace.

***So to summarize - things to pay attention to:***

- Curate your diet - information and actual
- Exercise regularly
- Sleep well
- Watch your substances
- Do something to enter a state of peace, like meditation

Every good doctor will say this to you, but I hope you now understand how and why these all will significantly impact your ability to keep your peace.

**Key Takeaway:** Your body and mind are deeply connected. Poor diet, lack of sleep, no exercise, and substances all destabilize your mental state and make it harder to maintain peace. Take care of your body, and it will be much easier to keep your mind equanimous. Commit to daily meditation practice to reset your mind.

## Principle 3: Free Yourself from Your Mind

Ok, this section might be a little hard for some people to hear, but it is the truth according to my own experience.

The key thing to understand is that, from day 1, your mind has been **conditioned**. This means that:

- Your mind is VERY sensitive to the things you experience, and it will automatically react to things with craving or aversion. It will see or hear something and say "Uhh I don't like it", or "YUMMM give me more ... I need more"
- For you, this practically means that your: core beliefs, moods, feelings, thoughts, and ultimately, behaviors, are very sensitive to what you are **conditioned** by.

Everything that you experience (and things that you don't even know you are experiencing) can and will ***condition*** your mind, including:

- Your genetics
- The people in your life
  - The people that raised you (your parents)
  - The people you hang out with (your friends)
  - The people you work with
- Your past experiences and memories and beliefs
  - Especially things that had a strong emotional impact on you
- Definitely everything we discussed above
  - Your information diet
  - Your actual diet
  - Your physical habits
  - Your meditation practice!!
- And of course, the rest of society
  - The news - both in your city and around the world
  - Money
  - Your culture and where you grew up
  - Your sports team winning or losing...

I could go on and on for days, but I hope you get the point. 

If you feel overwhelmed, and kind of scared, I do as well.

---
**A helpful analogy: the computer**
Think of a computer. A computer has lots and lots of software programs. These programs run on the computer and determine what you do - access the internet, play a game, listen to music.

Some of the programs are running all of the time (like your operating system). Some of the programs run some of the time (like your Notes app).

Your computer will determine which programs run. But you also determine which programs to run.

***Your mind works the same way.***

But it is a lot more complicated than a computer. It has many, many different software programs, each running (or not running) depending on what's going on in your day, and your life.

A lot of these programs you cannot control. And you wouldn't want to control - like imagine we were all in charge of controlling our breathing? (Yes, there is an unconscious program that controls this.)

But there are many, many programs that we want to change or to control - for example, the one that always runs when I am uncertain about something and feel super, super anxious.

Here's the key point:

**You can think of conditioning as the software programs that are running in your mind.**

These software programs can be created, and strengthened, by anything that you experience in your life (like I list above). And they can run (or get triggered) when you experience specified things. Like:
- You see a red car on the street, and your mind goes "Ooohhh cool red car" because of how much you like the Ferrari F1 team. 
- Or you eat a tomato one time when you are young and it really wasn't cooked well, and now you HATE tomatoes.
- Or you're parents didn't show you enough love growing up, and now you have trouble loving yourself (this one is tough)

I am simplifying things a lot here, but the key point is this:

- **Your mind is made up of software programs (conditioning) that will determine how you think, feel, and behave when you experience things in the world.**

---

Ok, I do have to say one more thing now, before we get to the light at the end of the tunnel: 

Everything that has had a strong emotional impact on you in your life might be strongly conditioning you now. It might be determining in large part your thoughts, feelings, and moods today. In fact, it might also be determining a good part of your personality (both the good and bad parts).

When children start out as children, they have a lot less conditioning, and over time it builds up and up and up.

There are obviously lots of things that you have no control over, like your genetics or your parents. But you have to accept that these things could have CONDITIONED your mind in very strong ways, for better or worse. This is why traumatic experiences (like growing up in poverty, for example) can significantly impact you for your whole life. The stronger the emotional impact of the experience on you, the stronger the conditioning tends to be.

These are the cards you've been dealt.

---

The good news is that YOU ultimately have the ability to reverse this conditioning, and to condition your mind in the way you want to. You can learn how to program your own mind... if you really put your mind to it :P

I won't get too deep into this, but the meditation practice I shared in Part 2 is the BEST way to start learning how to do this. Meditation is essentially you learning to observe your mind. You realize that YOU are not your mind, and you start to notice how it has been conditioned. As you get deeper and deeper into the practice, you will observe how your mind creates cravings or aversions to almost anything that you experience. And at some point, you might even get tired of this and say enough is enough.

This is the key point:
**When you become aware of these cravings or aversions, and YOU DON'T REACT to them (similar to what the meditation is training your mind to do), you begin the process of de-conditioning.**  

You are teaching your mind that you will not take action, and you are remaining equanimous. At some point, when you do this enough, the conditioning will start to have less and less impact on you.

Some of these things are **very deeply rooted** and it will be hard to change them overnight. Some might never change. But some will be easy and you can change them sooner. That is why you will need to put in some hard work, and to fight your own battles. You are the only one that can de-condition your mind.

But you owe it to yourself to try, and to take BACK control of your mind. And to choose how you want to live. Because ultimately ***your conditioning*** will determine how easy it will be for you to find and maintain your peace. This is a lifelong process and it is hard. You won't just magically reprogram your mind in a week. Be patient with yourself. Love yourself. The more and more you re-program, the more peace you will find.

**Key Takeaway:** Your mind has been programmed by everything you've experienced - genetics, parents, trauma, culture, diet, technology. Like software on a computer, these programs run automatically and determine your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Through meditation and non-reaction, you can begin to de-condition yourself and take back control of your mental programming.

---

## Principle 4: Focus on These Things to Free Your Mind

If you haven't yet read the section above (Principle 3), then please read it before continuing.

Now that we know what conditioning is, and the importance of de-conditioning our minds, how do we get started?

The way I think of freeing my mind is pretty simple:

- Step 1: I want to de-condition as much of the software programs that I don't want
- Step 2: I want to condition new software programs that I do want, or update ones that are already there

If you are reading this right now, you have the power to do this. Every human does.

But this is a very hard thing to do in practice. Two big reasons: 
- 1. **You might not know what software programs are being run, so how can you de-condition them?** Keep reading for what I think are the big ones, but the short answer is that you will have to find out for yourself what your conditioning has been. A lot of it might be obvious or become more obvious as your read this, like what you went through in childhood, how your parents treated you, what habits you have now that you don't like, how much you are on social media, etc. But there will be a lot you don't know (I definitely don't know what's deep down in my own mind). This guide, and meditation, will help you to start on this path for yourself.
- 2. **The environment we live in does not make it easy to de-condition your mind**. We are stimulated every day by technology and other things that condition us very strongly - the news, our friends fighting with us, greasy food, work. Life. Some days it seems like you can't get away from it all, but you actually have a lot more control over your de-conditioning than you think.

That's what this section will be all about. I'm going to discuss, from my own experience, some of the big things in modern life that are keeping (or kept) me conditioned in ways that I didn't want. And what you can do about it.

Some disclaimers:
- I'm focusing on these things because they personally had a huge impact on my mental health and peace, and I hope it will give you inspiration to try and do the same.
- There are definitely a lot more things out there, and some of these things might not apply to you. It is up to you to do the work for yourself and to find out what those things are.
- You will disagree with some of the stuff I say here. That's totally fine. This is my approach for de-conditioning my own mind, and it might not work for you. I'm sharing what works for me.

Ok, let's start...

--- 

**On Self-Image**

Your self-image is probably the most important thing to learn how to condition or re-condition for yourself.

Simply put: **How I view my self-image is the internal story I tell myself about myself.**

For example, when you are crushing it at work and getting a promotion next week, your mind might say to you, "Damn, you are so smart, I love you so much." That is a story your mind is telling you about yourself, based on the fact that you got a promotion.

Or, when you are not doing the 3 things you planned for the day, and you also didn't meditate, and didn't go to the gym, and your mind tells you: "Why are you so useless, you can't do anything consistently. You need to work harder or you will never succeed." That is another story your mind is spinning up about you, but this time based on your productivity level that day.

Or, let's say you've been feeling low energy or tired for the last month, and you catch your mind saying, "Why am you such a slob, and why do you look so bad, and what's wrong with your nose?" That is another story your mind is telling you, based on something as general as your low energy!

If you watch your mind closely, you will start to realize that it is actually saying these things to you all the time. And for most of the time, you are accepting it as you saying these things to you. This makes you feel what your mind wants you to feel. For example: 
- When your mind says "Why are you so useless..." you will start to feel sad and unmotivated. And you will probably try less as a result.
- Or when your mind says, "Wow you're so smart" you might feel happy or proud, and you might work extra hard the next week.

If you're saying, Nick, this is madness. How can this possibly be true? This is no way to live.

My answer to you, is yes, yes it is madness. Your mind is saying a lot of these things to you based on its **conditioning** and **what you're experiencing in that moment**. Most of which you have NO control over. That's why your constantly on an emotional rollercoaster.

If you still don't believe me, then don't. Seriously try out meditation in the way I laid out, and then start to observe your mind more closely. You will experience it yourself, and sometimes you might start to laugh at some of the BS it tells you. 

When you practice not reacting during meditation or in life, you are actually also practicing not reacting to this story that your mind is constantly telling you about yourself. And you hop off that emotional rollercoaster into ... some peace.

--- 

**On Technology**

I might trigger you with this one (and I covered it a lot with the bit on social media above), but I need to say this again...

Our phones today are probably one of the single biggest sources of **unwanted conditioning** we expose ourselves to.

I think many of us know, or are starting to feel this, but it's very clear that social media companies are designing their algorithms to keep us on their platform. It's how they make money - the more we watch and stay on the platform, the more ads they sell. The reason most social media is FREE is because they are selling YOUR attention as the product. 

And this will only get worse with smarter and smarter AI.

This means that social media companies are incentivized to take as much of your attention as they can possibly take. And guess what they will serve you up, if you're not careful? Stuff that is going to make you emotional, mostly in a negative way, stuff that is super catchy and that is "viral." This is called "brain rot" for a reason... **because it will just condition your brain to stay stuck on the platform endlessly scrolling for hours.**

This is very important to understand: your consciousness, and your experience of life, is in large part determined by your conditioning. And when you spend 3-4 hours a day on your phone doom-scrolling, you are conditioning your mind on that.

Have you ever played a video game for 10 hours a day and then started dreaming about that? Or have you just been binging a show and all you think about is the show? Or even when you first start dating someone, you can only think about them. Everything becomes about them. Social media works the same way.

If you feel like you have no energy, focus, you have lost productivity, or your zest for life, and/or feel numb. AND you spend all of your free time doom scrolling, then **you owe it to yourself to decondition yourself from social media, and maybe even technology for a little bit.**

**How do you do this?**

The most obvious thing to do is to put your phone away. Put it down, give it to someone you love and tell them not to give it back for an hour. Then do it for a day.

I know we all have responsibilities and jobs and kids, but I think all of us can find 1 hour in the week to not be on our phone. It was hard for me to do in the beginning, but once you feel how much simpler (and more peaceful) life is without your phone, you will NOT want it back. When they gave me my phone back after 10 days of not having it at the meditation course, I genuinely did not want it back.

If you can't put your phone away, the next best thing to do is to silence or curate your notifications or put time limits on social media (you should do this *even if* you can put your phone away too):
- The simplest thing is to put time limits (like 60 min, 30 min) on the social media apps that you use the most. And stick to them! Practice not reacting when that time-limit pops up and kicks you out.
- Then, silence or curate your notifications. This means they should not show up on your lock screen, appear as banners, or appear as RED DOTS on your phone.
- I'm a bit extreme, but I genuinely think that each notification has the potential to take my peace away. Especially social media notifications. If I want to reply to someone, I will go into my text messages, *on my own time*, and find that person and reply to them. Or I will pick up the phone and call. I don't need to be replying to everyone every SECOND of the day when a notification tells me to. And we don't all need to be texting each other 20 times a day. The people I care about understand that.
- Of course, keep the notifications that are important for work or those close to you. But silence the rest. Every single app you download (including the ones you use like once a year) will blast you with notifications these days. Most of these are just taking your attention away from you at times you don't want, and not really providing much value back. 
- I am extreme with this, but I feel best when nothing shows up on my phone screen the whole day. The only ones I keep on are: phone, transportation/food delivery apps (Uber, etc.), and anything truly time-sensitive (for example your work messaging app if you REALLY need to).

For social media apps specifically, you can start to CURATE your feeds. It's easier than you think to do this so that you get content that conditions you in a positive way - that inspires you, teaches you something, or gives you energy.

Social media can be useful, if you use it in the right way. For example:

- I find YOUTUBE to be the best platform for being able to curate the algorithm and to also learn genuinely useful stuff and to be inspired.
- You can curate your feed easily on YouTube by:
  - Telling the algorithm what you want to see more of:
    - Like a video
    - Save it
    - Share it
    - Watch it through to the end
  - Telling the algorithm what you DON'T want to see more of:
    - Dislike it
    - Click on the three dots and say "I'm not interested in this" or "Don't show it again"
  - Do this for 10-20 videos on your feed, refresh your feed, and you will already start to notice the changes.

You are ultimately responsible for curating your digital environment (and your "information diet"). This means cleaning your feed up when it's serving up too much brain rot. Same as eating healthy. If you're buying a bunch of candy and putting it next to your fridge, you will just eat the candy all day. Clean up your feed.

Finally, if you can't silence your notifications or put your phone away, and are continuing to struggle, then you should seriously think about deleting your social media accounts, or at least putting them on pause for a while. This is the only true detox.

My aunt once told me: "The most basic, simple life is the happiest." When you strip down life to the basics - what you care about, who you love, and what you enjoy doing - life becomes a lot simpler. You don't need your phone to constantly stimulate you to be happy. You don't need AI to tell you how to think and feel. These are tools that should enable us to be more human, not keep us dependent on them to function.

**On Money**

My mom said to me the other day "I make money to live, I don't live for money."

This section might not make you feel good, as it is a sensitive topic. But I do have to cover it.

Whether you don't have enough money or have too much money, I think the reality with money, for most of us, is this:

**It is probably one of the biggest things conditioning our minds right now.**

I'm not saying that you shouldn't focus on making money. I'm saying that your beliefs and thoughts about money, regardless of how much you have, will significantly impact your ability to find and maintain your peace.

For example:

- If you think you don't have enough money, and you genuinely don't, you might become really focused on making it. You might be living paycheck-to-paycheck right now and really struggling. And all you can think about is not being in this situation. You are strongly craving for your situation to change, and also strongly averse to your current situation because you want it to continue. This is a double-edge conditioning sword.
- If you think you have a lot of money, you're also not immune to this. You might become really focused on not losing your money (aversion) or obsessed with making even more money to buy more things (craving). You might have millions of dollars (or billions), yet you find yourself working harder than ever, your health declining, not really showing up for your family or friends, and still feeling like there's something missing in your life.

I'm not saying you should not make your money. And I'm not saying that everyone reading this is going to feel like this about money.

But I will tell you this, I was in both of these situations .. from being in debt for most of my life to recently selling my company. And the sudden influx of money did not magically give me peace and help me maintain it. Yes, having more of it did significantly improve my life. It helped me to survive, to do things I couldn't do before, and to take care of my family. And yes, it gave me more time and freedom to focus on finding my peace (I won't lie to you about this one).

But deep down, I was not at peace, and in fact I was struggling just as much as before: "I'm going to lose my money", "I'm spending too much", "I need at least 10x more", "What do the markets look like today?", "I need to start working again, I can't take a vacation". 

The thoughts are endless, because money strongly conditions your mind, whether you have a lot of it or not.

You ultimately have to do the hard work to find your own peace. Money will not do it for you.

--- 

So why not start to decondition your mind away from money now? Regardless of your financial situation.

Again, I will share what helped me to do this, but you will have to go on your own journey (this is especially the case for money).

First, I sound like a broken record at this point, but take the meditation practice *seriously*. 

It really helped me to see how toxic my relationship with money is.

I realized that a lot of my worries in my life (like "I'm not working enough," "I'm working on the wrong things," "I'm not doing this or that") are stemming from wanting more money in my life (craving), or being afraid that I was going to lose my money (aversion).

I also realized that I need much less money than I think I do. I accepted the fact that I still need to work hard, but I stopped believing that I absolutely needed this MUCH money or that much money for me to finally be at peace. And I accepted the fact that if I lost all my money today then I will still be here. And I will survive, one way or another.

As I started to do this, I started to find it easier to maintain my peace. I recognize this is easier said than done if you're struggling financially. But honestly, I wish I told myself this when I was struggling because I made it so much worse on myself. I won't lie to you, if you are in a tough place financially, you are going to have to work hard, and it's not going to be easy. But don't do it by sacrificing your peace. I went to school and worked for 12 straight years without taking a real vacation. And I lost most of my physical and mental health multiple times along the way. And yes, some of this was from the hard work and was unavoidable, but a lot of it was from my relationship with money.

I do really believe that the less you tie your peace to having enough money, the easier it will be to find and maintain peace. In some cases, when you let go of money, you might end up making more money. You might end up focusing on genuinely helping people, and doing work that adds value to people's lives, instead of trying to make as much money as possible. 

Finally, if you are looking at me and are like, Nick, "it's easy for you to say all this stuff about money, you just sold your company," please understand that we are in one of the **craziest** times in history:

- If you are a human and have lived, have access to the internet, and can hold a conversation with a chatbot, then you have some skill or experience that CAN help someone else. And is valuable to someone else.
- No other time in history was it possible for a single person to go on the internet, talk to an AI, and use it to help them create actual impact with their unique experience and skill. Whatever it might be - sharing your authentic message or skill on social media, building a website or app, or distributing your service or product online. You can do something, likely within the next week, and you can use AI for pretty much free to help you do it. 
- It does not matter how old you are, what your educational background is, or what you went through in life. This is the time we live in today, and this was not possible 5 years ago.

To get started, try this:
- 1. Spend the next 5 minutes of your free-time talking to your favourite AI about what it is you could be doing to make money with AI or online. You can even share this section as context so it knows what you want to do! Just copy and paste. Also share some background information about you - who you are, what you do, what you are good at, what you are passionate about.
- 2. Come up with a very simple plan with the AI, and commit to trying it out. Whatever it is. For 30 days. If the plan does not seem realistic or too complicated, ask the AI to simplify it.
- 3. Commit whatever amount of free-time you have per week (can even be a few hours) to executing on that plan. Keep the AI updated. Talk to it as you do stuff, and be ok with changing the plan if it is not working. 
- 4. Commit to keeping your mind in a peaceful state. This will improve your ability to use AI because it will help you with things like:
  - Figuring out are you actually good at, or what experience do you have, that people would genuinely find useful
  - Focusing long enough to build something and release it into the world with the AI

It really is as simple as that to get started. 

And to be honest, this is one of the most important skills you can learn in our modern era. The AI will only get smarter and more capable which means: 
- It will automate more and more jobs
- But ... it will also allow you to do more and more things, and to make money from them

A few other notes on this: 
- Your initial plan and idea might not work. Don't get discouraged. I failed so many times before my startup started working. Commit to doing this for each day for at least 30 days, and talk to your AI. Tell it what you're frustrated by, what's not working, and tell it you need help. Come up with a new plan and keep going
- As long as you keep going, and maintain your equanimity, things will work. Eventually something will work, and you will figure out a way to make money. You just have to not let your mind tell you it's time to quit.
- You can also build anything with AI today, and your mind is the key. **A peaceful mind is the key!**

A few more notes, because this is very important ... 
- I'm also not telling you to quit your full-time job to do this. You can build A LOT of stuff these days in a few hours per week, on the side. Get creative, and as long as you have a clear direction on what you want to build, and are genuinely excited about it, you will be able to build it.
- Try to focus on what you are good at and passionate about. Do not just create things you think will make you the most money. Focus on things that will genuinely help people, and your money will come. You will attract the people that need what you are building, if it is truly authentic to you, they will come, and you will make your money.

The reason I feel comfortable saying all these things about AI so strongly is I've been in AI for 9 years - I was in the space 6 years before ChatGPT came out. I built and sold an AI company. And I work with it for 10 hours a day these days. I can tell you that AI has gotten to a point where it will help you make the money you need. You just need to try.

If you are serious about this, I wrote a manual on AI programming here: [https://github.com/nicolasahar/morphic-programming](https://github.com/nicolasahar/morphic-programming). It's also free (just like this one), but this one is for people that have some more experience with using AI tools like Claude Code. I might come out with a guide for people that are just starting out at some point. But you also don't need this guide. 

Go follow the 4 steps I laid out above, and happy building!

**On Desire**

Desire is any craving or aversion that your mind generates in response to something. It's as simple as that.

Desire is also going to be the main cause of most of the suffering your mind will inflict on you. The reason that is the case is that:

- When you *crave* something, you want it to happen REALLY badly. And when it doesn't happen, you don't feel so great.
- When you are *averse* to something, you really DON'T want it to happen. And when it happens, you also don't feel so great.

So if you can learn how to not react to your mind when it presents you with a reaction of craving or aversion, then you can slowly free yourself from a lot of the suffering that you will end up experiencing when things don't really go your way.

And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but things will NOT go your way, at least some of the time. Life is life. And most things are out of your control. The richest, most powerful people also suffer. But when you allow your mind to make you feel really high when you get what you want, or really low when you don't get what you want, you will end up not having a great time.

As you can see from the above, I gave three examples of in our modern world that create the most craving or aversion for us - technology, money, and our own self-image. These are usually tied to strong desires. But there are many, many more.

There will be many that are unique to you, your life, and who you are.

I will leave you with this: **You owe yourself, for the sake of your own peace, to find out what your strongest desires are and try your best to decondition yourself from them.**

I'm not saying you shouldn't have any pleasure in your life. I'm saying don't let your mind run the show and tell you what to crave and what to stay away from.

There is obviously a lot of suffering in the world that we cannot control or get rid of, like death or natural disasters. But there is a lot of suffering that we make up in our minds, and that we do have control over. Focus on that.

---

What I shared in this section will hopefully give you the basic tools you need to start to:

1. Decondition your mind from things that you don't want in there
2. Condition your mind to things that you do want
3. Find and maintain your peace

I keep repeating this over and over, but this is not going to be easy. And only you can do the work. And the reason I focus so much on meditation is that it is genuinely the most effective way I've found to do this work. Meditation is like the gym for your mind.

Also, when you find that you don't have enough time to do this, keep telling yourself this:

**This is probably some of the most important work you can be doing in your life to change it. And it is how you will ultimately find and maintain your peace.**

---

**The Simplest Way to Maintain Your Peace**

Here is the simplest way I can summarize maintaining your peace...

If you are about to do something or react in a way that you think will take your peace away - *including* taking someone else's peace away - then stop and ask yourself: **"Is this *really* worth my peace?"**

Just stop and think about it for 1 second... "Is it *really*, positively, **absolutely** worth it?"

If yes, then carry on. But I usually find that if I have to ask myself this question, then NO, it's not *really* worth my peace.

There will be many, many things in life that will try to take your peace from you, from the small to the big: yourself, other people, food, the news, lying, someone cutting you off in line, a fly buzzing in your ear, the weather, your phone, someone leaving you a nasty comment on social media (or you doing that to someone), someone's voice that just annoys you, a greasy burger you know you shouldn't eat, getting fired, your team losing the championship, your partner saying something stupid. The list goes on and on.

In fact, **anything** can take your peace from you... IF you let it.

But very few things in life are *really* worth your peace. I personally have not found anything worth my peace, and I try really hard to prove myself wrong.

The problem is you (like me) will forget to ask yourself this question in the heat of the moment, and we will react. And we will lose our peace. Over and over and over again.

But it's ok if that happens too. What's important is you practice noticing when you have lost your peace. Because you can get it back once you train your mind.

**Measure yourself by how fast you can get back to your peace.** And more practically, practice asking yourself this question over and over so that you condition your mind to think of it in the heat of the moment. You are the only one that can do this. And if you are a human, you CAN do this.

I like to think of my full-time job (alongside my actual job) as being in charge of keeping my own peace. I worked really hard to be able to find it, and NO, I won't give it up that easily. So YES, I take it as seriously as my full-time job. And I hope you will too.

---

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on deconditioning from the three biggest peace-killers in modern life: self-image (the story you tell yourself about yourself), technology (designed to hijack your attention and trigger reactions), and money (the endless craving/aversion cycle). At the root of all of these is desire - craving and aversion. Find your strongest desires and work to decondition yourself from them. This is some of the most important work you can do.

# Part 4: Channeling Your Peace

Once you are able to get into a state of peace and start to maintain it, you can start thinking about how to channel it. This is where things can get really fun.

I will share a few principles, again from my practical experience. But please know this section is NOT comprehensive, and you will find your own principles and ways to channel your peace. I'm including some for inspiration ONLY.

You will also find that the more you channel your peace, the easier it will be to find and maintain it.

---

## Principle 1: Working in a Flow State

Everyone always talks about getting into this state of "flow." How it feels so good and you are the most productive version of yourself, and you literally feel like time is slipping away.

For the longest time, it was so hard for me to actually be in "flow."

There's all these books on flow (like this one: [Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow)), and they do help to intellectualize this.

But what I recently realized is that you can train your mind to get the **state of flow**, similar to how we trained ourselves to get into the **state of peace**.

And it is MUCH easier to get into flow state when your mind is in the peace state. And also vice-versa.

**So, here's my approach:**

1. **Minimize distractions** - I try to address things I know will distract me. For me, it's things like:
   - **Being hungry** - I eat a good, healthy meal that won't make me feel bloated or groggy
   - **Being sleepy** - I get a good night's rest
   - **Constantly checking my phone** - I put my phone on Airplane mode and away from me
   - **Having something urgent to do** - I don't have to go to the dentist in an hour or jump on a Zoom call in 10 min

2. **Set a general intention** - I set a general intention for myself. Something like:
   - I want to work on my AI project
   - I want to draw
   - I want to reflect about my life and this last year

3. **I meditate** - I do my best to meditate based on the techniques I described. This is important because:
   - I find that the meditation just "resets" my mind, whatever state I'm in. It becomes more equanimous, calm, and focused.
   - I find it's easier to stay in focused flow the better I am at staying in focused meditation.
   - Of course, I don't do a 60-minute meditation before every flow session, but I try to at least not use my phone or do something that calms my mind down.

For all these steps, find out what works for you, experiment around, and you will develop your own routine.

A few notes on intention-setting:

- I can't tell you what intention to set. Or how specific to set it.
- Some people will say, set a clear "goal" or intention.
- I find that my flow state is stronger and more long-lasting if I set a general intention (I want to work on my AI). For me, I try my best not to control or dictate what I'm doing, and just do stuff. For example, I might go into a flow session with 3 goals for building my AI. But 10 minutes in, I might get a flash of inspiration to a fourth task I had thought of before, or something completely new. I try to follow these **flashes of inspiration**, because I like to think of it as the flow state expressing itself.
- Of course, if I get too out of scope (for example, I am trying to work on building my AI, and I end up just building my lego for 3 hours), then sure I reel myself in to go work on my AI.
- I also understand if your job or activity doesn't allow you to do this. Which is why I can't tell you what intentions to set, or how closely to follow them during flow.

**Key Takeaway:** Flow state becomes much more accessible when your mind is already at peace. The formula: minimize distractions (hunger, tiredness, phone), set a general intention, and meditate to reset your mind. Then let the flow state express itself - follow flashes of inspiration rather than rigidly sticking to a plan.

---

## Principle 2: Taking Action

One of the strongest ways to channel your peace is to take consistent action towards things that you want to do, or know you should be, doing. 

One of the key things that I seriously hold myself accountable to is this:

- ***Have I taken action on what I know I need to do?***

For me this means things like:

- If I know I need to eat better, then I am taking it seriously and actually trying to eat better
- If I know I need to spend more time with my mom, then I am taking that seriously and actually trying to spend more time with my mom
- If I know I can't be friends with someone because their values don't align with mine, then I need to stop being friends with them

Only you know if you are taking something seriously or not. And only you know what you need to do.

---

I find that the more you take action on things you know you need to do, but have not done, the more at peace you will be.

- Try this for yourself. Take 2 minutes and write down 1 thing you know you should be doing, and that you have been putting off. And just do it. And then observe how you feel 2 minutes after.

The more things you are delaying or procrastinating, and you know you need to be doing them, the less at peace you will be.

---

Of course, there are many things that I don't know I need to do, but that I should be doing. I like to think of this as my **ignorance**.

Ignorance is NOT a bad thing - it's simply stuff that I don't yet know I need to do. We all have this stuff, and it's impossible not to have any. Don't judge yourself for it.

But the good news is that your mind and body are usually aware of your ignorance before you are. And they start to communicate it to you with things like:

- Anxiety
- Tension in your body
- A sinking feeling or pit in your stomach
- Sadness
- Constant racing thoughts

Our bodies and minds are much more aware and smarter than we give them credit for. And at some level, somewhere deep in your mind, your mind knows what you need to be doing but aren't.

---

You might be saying, "Nick - I feel these things now, but I have no idea what I need to be doing? I'm lost."

Then start by meditating. Start by seriously committing to what I'm sharing in the other parts of this guide. At some point, when you are brushing your teeth or walking your dog, your mind might wander, and you might realize one of these things.

You alone will know what you need to do... and your mind and body will tell you if you start listening.

---

When this starts happening to you, the key thing you should hold yourself accountable to is this:

- **Have I taken action on this?**

In my experience, this is the only thing you CAN do once some ignorance has been lifted. Take action. And try your genuine best.

Do not measure yourself on the outcome. You have no control over the outcome, and it will only cause you to lose your peace (and your mind).

For example:

- You are trying really hard to get a promotion at work, but you just got declined for one. You feel sad and don't want to work anymore and feel like quitting. 
  - You are measuring yourself on the outcome (you didn't get a promotion), INSTEAD of the fact that you tried your best (the action). You have built such a strong craving for that promotion, that when it didn't come, you felt crushed.
  - Remember: Life is life. Things will not go your way all the time. You can't let that dictate your peace.

- You have a really tough relationship with your dad, and you have genuinely tried to smooth things over, but you are both drifting apart. You feel sad, kind of depressed, and you want to give up on him. 
  - You *might* be measuring yourself on the outcome (you and your dad are drifting apart) INSTEAD of focusing on the fact that you are trying your best with him (the action). Of course this one is a tricky situation, because you are probably also sad that you won't get to spend time with your dad. But hopefully this illustrates the point. You tried your genuine best.

It's also ok to feel these feelings, especially when things don't go your way. I'm not saying you should feel guilty for being sad that you didn't get that promotion. I'm saying that the more and more you focus your mind on the genuine action you took, and not the outcome, the more and more these feelings CAN and WILL change.

**Key Takeaway:** Only you know what you need to do. And only you can do it. Measure yourself by the action you take, and whether or not you are trying your genuine best - not by outcomes you can't control. Procrastination and avoiding what you know you need to do will erode your peace. Your body will tell you what you're avoiding through anxiety, tension, and racing thoughts - listen to it.

---

## Principle 3: Focus on Helping Others

One of the most important ways you can channel your peace is to focus on genuinely trying to help other people - in your day-to-day life, and in your work.

**For me, I try to ask myself:**

- **Am I there for my family and people that I care about?** Am I compassionate, supportive, and empathetic to them? Do I make time for them, and do I do my best in these relationships?

- **Am I also treating strangers like this?** Especially when I have nothing to gain in return.

- **Is what I'm working on genuinely improving people's lives? Or am I actually causing suffering?** Only you know the truth for this one.
  - A side note - when you switch your focus in work from making money or getting that promotion, to genuinely trying to help people, then a few things will tend to happen:
    - You **will** do better at work - people will sense this shift, and you will find that they will be on your side, trust you more, and even open doors for you
    - Your mind will stop craving for money or promotions - you won't be obsessing over the promotion (you will still work hard), and you will enjoy the process a lot more
  - This is one of the hardest shifts to make, because our world is so tied to money, promotions, and progress, and because you ultimately need money to survive. But you *can* make money while still focusing on helping people. AND you will find peace along the way.

- **Are you following your authentic self and what you authentically want?**
  - Ask yourself this: "Am I doing things for the sake of doing them, because my friends and family think I should be doing them? OR because I genuinely feel in my heart that these are the things that I WANT to be doing?"
  - If you feel some deep existential tension in your mind or body, or just a general dissatisfaction with your life and how things are going, this is usually a symptom (in my experience). Your mind and body are trying to tell you that you are not on the path you know you need to be on. Only you know what your path is, and only you can have the strength to walk it.
  - Finding your peace will also make that path more clear to you, if it isn't already. **So you owe it to yourself and everyone you care about to find and keep your peace.**

**Key Takeaway:** Channel your peace by shifting your focus from self-centered goals (money, promotions, status) to genuinely helping others. This shift will paradoxically help you succeed more, because people sense authenticity. Be there for your family and strangers alike. Make sure your work actually improves lives. Follow your authentic path, not what others expect of you.

---

## Principle 4: Focus on Reducing Suffering

One of the best ways to channel your peace is to do your best to not cause suffering.

For me this means:

- I won't intentionally do things to other people that I wouldn't want someone else to do to me
- This means things like lying, stealing, manipulating, or generally just saying things that are hurtful

This not only has a huge impact on other people, but it is one of the biggest things that will also help you maintain your peace.

Example: Lying

Take lying, for example. We all do it. Little white lies every day. We've all told a big lie at one point or another.

When you lie, you are actually doing it because of some craving or aversion in your mind.

- **Example 1:** You tell your boss things are going great with your progress, but they really are falling apart. This is aversion. You are too afraid to tell the truth because your boss might react strongly, and there might be conseqeunces.
- **Example 2:** You don't tell your partner how you really feel even though you know it's good for them - you are afraid of what they will say and that it will start a big fight. This is aversion. You are too afraid of telling your partner *your* truth because you think it will lead to emotional distress for both of you, or it will hurt their feelings.

***Lying can be saying something that you know is not true, OR not saying something that you know is true.***

In both cases, you feel so compelled to lie because you either want something really badly (a craving), or you want to avoid something really badly (an aversion).

**So ask yourself, is this lie really worth the cost of my peace?**

Of course, you can also do a bunch of stuff that will cause more suffering to people than lying, like stealing or punching someone in the face because they said something you didn't like.

These actions will have even stronger and stronger impacts on your peace, because the underlying craving or aversion is stronger. You *really* need to be craving something for you to justify stealing it, for example. Or someone must have really struck a deep chord with you for you to justify punching them.

Of course, you might be in a genuinely dire situations - like you are about to starve to death if you don't steal a piece of food. But if you're reading this guide you're likely not in this situation.

But what this also points to is another key point:

- **Your intention for the action is very important.**

For example:

- Stealing to save your starving children is NOT the same as carjacking a car at gunpoint.

I don't think I have to explain this very much, but the second one is a sure-fire way to destabilize your peace...

Finally, I do believe that we should all aim to apply this principle of reducing suffering to animals (all beings in general).

Whether or not you think animals experience suffering (I believe they do but you can disagree), the important thing to remember is that your mind is doing something that is causing suffering. And at some point, this will cause you to lose your peace.

I'm not sitting here telling you what to do, or not to do. I'm just telling you, before you do stuff, ask yourself, "Is this worth my peace?"

If you feel something stir up in your gut, then you probably have your answer.

**Key Takeaway:** Causing suffering in others - through lying, manipulation, hurtful words, or worse - usually stems from craving or aversion in your own mind. These actions destabilize your peace, often more than whatever you were trying to gain or avoid. Before any action, ask yourself: "Is this worth my peace?" Your gut will tell you the answer.

# Part 5: Conclusion and Parting Words

The main reason I wrote this guide is that I believe that if everyone reads and genuinely applies the principles in this guide, then the world will be a better place for us all.

If you are frustrated with the state of the world, and don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, then:

1. Seriously commit yourself to the what I shared
2. Share this guide with someone that you care about or that needs to hear it, and tell them they should seriously read through this and also commit themselves to this

**If you gained anything from this guide, I hope it's the following:**

- **Peace is a trainable state.** It's not some wishy-washy abstract thing - it's an actual skill you can start practicing TODAY. Your mind can be trained to enter and stay in this state through things like meditation and conscious awareness.

- **Equanimity is the key.** Both to good things and bad things. The less you react with craving or aversion, the more at peace you will be.

- **Meditation is the most effective tool I've found.** If it's never worked for you, please give the specific techniques in this guide an honest shot. Commit to trying Mental Exercise 1 to the best of your ability, once a day for 30 days, and see how you feel. If you genuinely aren't seeing any changes, then ignore my advice. Meditation is also not the only way, so find your path.

- **Your peace is shaped by what you pay attention to and what you do.** Your information diet (especially social media), your actual diet, exercise, sleep, and substances all directly impact your ability to maintain peace. Curate these carefully.

- **Your mind has been conditioned since birth.** By genetics, parents, experiences, culture, technology, money - everything. But you can decondition yourself and take back control through meditation and non-reaction.

- **Channel your peace into meaningful action.** Help others. Follow your authentic path. Reduce suffering. These activities reinforce and deepen your peace.

- **The simplest life is the happiest.** My aunt once told me this, and it stuck with me. When you strip down life to the basics - what you care about, who you love, and what you enjoy doing - life becomes a lot simpler. You don't need constant stimulation to be happy.

- **Before you react, ask yourself: "Is this *really* worth my peace?"** Is this comment worth my peace? Is this burger worth my peace? Is this argument worth my peace? If you have to ask, the answer is usually no.

And remember: I don't claim to have all the answers, and I still struggle with this too. This guide is as much a reminder for me as it is for you. I come back to it when I need to.

If you've taken this guide seriously and are starting to see some benefits in your life, and want to go even deeper, then take a shot at the 10-day silent Vipassana meditation course. Link here again: [https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/qanda](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/qanda)

- I really do believe that the course I did allowed me to find and maintain my peace much easier than if I tried to do it in my day-to-day life.
- Yes, it was the hardest thing I have done in a LONG time, but it allowed me to fully focus on my mind - I did not have to battle with any of the stimulation, the processed food, the constant temptations on my phone, or the outside world. And I got dedicated instruction from people that actually knew what they were doing. I felt a lot more equipped to maintain my peace in the chaos of the outside world.
- But this might not be realistic for you. So if you can't take 10 days to do one of these courses, try to: 1. Disconnect from the world for 10 days and do it by yourself (the website has resources), and 2. Take this guide seriously.

Finally, like I said in the introduction, I am fully focused on building AI for mental and spiritual health. I wrote a similar, free guide for how to use AI to be more productive in your life here: [https://github.com/nicolasahar/morphic-programming](https://github.com/nicolasahar/morphic-programming). It is more on the technical side, but I'm leaving it here in case it helps.

**I wish you all peace in 2026 and beyond :)**

# Appendix

## Tips for Mental Exercise 1

**This one seems very simple, but there are very important tips for you to follow to properly train your mind in preparation for Exercise 2.**

You will NOT have a good time in Exercise 2 if you don't take Exercise 1 seriously.

- **Observe the reality of your sensations, from moment to moment, as they are.** This means you:
  - Do not go "searching" for sensations - don't tell yourself, "I need to feel the breath," or "I need to feel this tingling." This is a mental craving (the "I need") that will distract your mind and make the task harder.
  - Any time you make the task harder, your mind will lose focus, equanimity, and you will make it harder on yourself (you WILL experience more discomfort).

- **Remain equanimous to anything that happens.** Stuff WILL happen that you don't want to:
  - If your mind wanders to an area outside of the nostrils/upper lip, like your back pain or some tickling sensation, try your best to catch it and move it back to this area.
  - Your mind WILL wander, especially if you have pain. But as long as you catch it faster every time, you are making progress.

- **The more you can keep your mind on the prescribed area, the sharper and more focused your mind will get.** This means:
  - It will become easier for it to not react to sensations outside of the area
  - It will become easier for it to not react to racing or random thoughts you have during the exercise
  - You might start to experience more focus and concentration in your day-to-day life
  - You might start to experience finer and finer sensations on the prescribed area - sensations you could not feel before

- **Your mind getting sharper** - the way I like to think of it is like a magnifying glass or microscope. Your mind will start to be able to zoom in more and feel more and more subtle sensations on the prescribed area. But you will quickly realize that as soon as your mind races, or pain pops up, you lose the ability to zoom and you stop feeling the sensations. Just observe this.

## Tips for Mental Exercise 2

If you take the instructions in Exercise 2 seriously, you will quickly realize that it is a really, really hard thing to master .. but it is extremely powerful to get your mind into a state of inner peace.

A few of my thoughts on this exercise:

- **It's supposed to be hard on purpose.** When the teacher told us what the goal was for the first time, I had a mental breakdown... "How can someone just sit there and not move for a whole hour and just do the body scan over and over and over... AND then we have to do this for 7 more hours today?" I started shaking and crying.
  - I'm not saying you have to push your body and mind to this degree, but I'm saying that the more you can not react to the discomfort and pain, the faster you will train your mind to reach a state of equanimity. I pushed through some very serious pain that first time, and it made it significantly easier to sit for an hour without moving the next day (and beyond). 
  - Go at your own pace. The more you don't move and follow these instructions, the faster you will train your mind.

- **It WILL get easier.** Especially if you have a really difficult session. You will feel so much better after the session, and your mind will be the most calm.

- **The hardest sessions yield the best results.** I found out that the sessions where I have the most pain, or most racing thoughts or discomfort, and that I don't move for the whole hour, that my mind is the **most** clear, equanimous, and peaceful AFTER the session AND for the whole day.
  - This will literally flush out your mind and stabilize it into a state of inner peace. So welcome the pain and discomfort as a chance for you to flush out your system.

- **Commit to at least 1 hour a day in the beginning.** It does not matter how many times you move or how many times your mind wanders. If you get discouraged, you are reacting and your mind will lose its equanimity.
  - The importance of doing this **every day** is that things will happen to you in your day that will destabilize your mind. It is unavoidable. The meditation practice will help you "reset" your mind and regain your peace, no matter what happens.

- **As you progress in the exercise, you will start to feel finer and finer sensations.** On your skin and nostrils in exercise 1, and on various areas of your body in exercise 2. Your mind will also be able to stay in the areas you want it to without wandering as much.
  - According to the teacher, you should be able to feel sensations on 100% of your body, 100% of the time. This is the end goal. And I can tell you I am nowhere near this, but I have still found lots of peace. 
  - I know it's also hard to belive that you can sense 100% of your body, but you start to experience it the more you progress. Your mind (and mine) are just not sharp or focused enough to feel them. 
  - The amount, and subteltly of sensations you feel is a good yardstick to know you are making progress. Your mind will become sharper, more subtle, more focused in real life as well.
  - At some point, the teacher says you will be able to feel your whole body as a wave of tingling or vibrating sensation. I experienced this a few times, and it requires ultra-pure focus. You will lose it as soon as your mind gets distracted or you react to some thought. But again, you should not go searching for this, or cling to this as something you NEED to experience. I know it seems counter-intuitive, but you will just shoot yourself in the foot and you won't feel this the moment you want to feel it.

- **For experienced meditators:** Try not to use any visualizations or verbalizations (like mantras or your imagination). And try not to play "time" games with yourself.
  - The goal is to observe your physical sensations through each part of your body, and nothing more.
  - Every other mental computation in addition to this is actually going to make it harder for you to do this task. I still struggle with this every time, but the goal is to just get to a state of pure observation, regardless of what happens.

## A Note on Meditation Logs

For those of you that are scientists and love experimenting, I recommend keeping a meditation log. It can be a very simple journal that includes a short entry after each meditation. Things like:

- How did you feel before, during, and after the meditation?
- How equanimous did you remain? What physical sensations or thoughts took your mind out of equanimity? How long did it take for you to regain your equanimity?
- How much pain or discomfort did you experience?
- How many times did you move?
- Did you try new things and how did they work (like sitting differently, or eating a small breakfast right before, or turning your phone off for 20 min before)?

**Many, many things will impact your meditation. Start to take notice.** For example, I find that the more I have something going on in my life that is stressing me out, the harder it becomes to fully focus on the body scans. But as I do 3-4 body scans, my mind settles in. Your mind is very, very sensitive!

For me, keeping a log helps me track my progress, and also figure out what is working and what different things I can try with my posture or sitting. You **don't** have to do this, but I find it helps (I do it maybe once every 3-4 meditations). You can also incorporate this into your daily journal if you write one. I find these are useful reflection questions for daily life as well.
