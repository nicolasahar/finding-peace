## Read it here
Start here: [**finding_peace_guide_v1.md**](./finding_peace_guide_v1.md)

**If there's anything I ask of you, it's:**
1. Take what I say seriously, and try it
2. When you feel the benefits, share it with 1 person you care about. Start with your mom, or daughter/son, or partner, and help them on their own path

I really do believe that if we all take finding and maintaining our peace seriously, then the world will be a better place!

## Why I Wrote This

I struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my 20s. I tried antidepressants, therapy, different lifestyles - nothing really stuck.

Over the years, I slowly started figuring things out. What actually works. What doesn't. What matters for peace and what's just noise.

A 10-day silent meditation retreat in Bali was a turning point - but it wasn't magic. The years of struggle before it, and the daily practice after it, matter just as much. This is a lifelong process. I'm still on it.

This guide is everything I've learned so far - the principles, the practices, and the mindset shifts that actually helped me find (and keep) my peace.

## A Quick Word About Me

I trained as a medical doctor at the University of Toronto, then left to build an AI healthcare startup ([Semantic Health](https://betakit.com/semantic-health-acquired-by-us-based-medical-documentation-firm-aapc/)) which I sold in 2025. I'm now focused on building AI for mental and spiritual health.

## Why GitHub?

I want this to be open-source. Peace shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or gatekept by gurus.

If something here helps you, use it. Share it.

## Disclaimers

- **This is free.** I don't want anything from you.
- **I'm a doctor by training, but not your doctor.** This is not medical advice. These are my personal views from my own experience.
- **I still struggle with this stuff.** This is a lifelong practice. This guide is as much a reminder for me as it is for you.
- **The first person I sent this to was my mom.** There's nothing here I wouldn't say to someone I love.

I also wrote a more technical guide on working with AI agents: [Morphic Programming](https://github.com/nicolasahar/morphic-programming). This will help you improve your productivity with AI, but it might require you to be a bit more technical.

**I wish you all peace in 2026 and beyond :)**
